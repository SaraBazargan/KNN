the sign in front of the steepled church read sunday sermon does god prefer particular sports teams a man passing by gives the sign a befuddled look the scene is in fact a cartoon in the current new yorker but the question is a good one since it has more or less been in the news the guy checking out the sign might very well have been aware of the strange one hesitates to say celestial sports goings on in new york and chicago in recent weeks in fact supernatural and miracle win were among the encomiums not infrequently used regarding certain yankee postseason triumphs the same has been true for the bears in three of the bears last four games they have won in stunning fashion on sunday they were leading 27 24 near the end when tampa bay 's 49 yard field goal attempt hit the right upright bears win earlier the bears won two straight against san francisco and cleveland by rallying to tie the game in the fourth quarter and win it in overtime against the 49ers mike brown intercepted a pass in overtime and ran it in for the victory against cleveland same guy did it again why the bears atop the their division with a 7 2 mark why now we 've gotten some breaks said the head coach dick jauron who was 11 21 in his first two seasons there 's no doubt the ball 's bounced our way more than it has the last two seasons hmm yes now no one is quite sure what reason might be behind a greater power looking especially kindly on chicago and the bears new york however was a different story after the tragic events on sept 11 it was said that the yankees spectacular grit raised the city 's spirit it began with the yankees coming back from two games down against oakland in the division series with a phenomenal play by derek jeter but one the yankees actually practiced saving the yankees from what might have been a series ending loss the yankees stormed back to win the next two games and the series and as a reminder to those fans who happened to be standing in line on broadway for cancellations for the producers and missed all the action the yankees down by two games to one to arizona in the world series won two straight games in suspiciously similar fashion trailing with two outs in the ninth inning of game 4 the yankees tied the score on a two run homer and another homer in the 10th won it in game 5 same thing behind with two outs in the ninth and a two run homer tied the game the yankees then won it in the 12th the yankees alas lost the series to essentially a better diamondbacks team but the free agent period in which players could begin signing yesterday reminds us that miracles have had less to do with the yankee success in recent years than with their good free agent picks mike mussina and david wells for two and good trades such as those for roger clemens tino martinez and scott brosius as well as a farm system that produced the likes of jeter andy pettitte and bernie williams the arizona miracles rested primarily in the left and right arms of randy johnson and curt schilling the bears like the yankees have added important free agents this season signing ted washington at 380 pounds and keith traylor at 340 to erect a virtual wall on the defensive line their top two draft picks running back anthony thomas and receiver david terrell have each had substantial impact and some of our other players are maturing and the players absolutely do n't give up said bill mcgrane director of administration for the bears what about deific intervention there 's an old russian proverb he said it goes 'pray devoutly hammer stoutly religion has often played a part in sports including pregame prayers the rev edward a malloy president of notre dame said if both sides are praying who is god paying attention to it 's like it has more to do with our sense of preparation and dependency rather than legitimately expecting god is going to favor one side over the other bernardo harris a packer linebacker had said it another way before his team 's game against the bears two weeks ago he said he could n't be bothered with talk about the bears being a miracle team we 're worried about hitting people in the mouth making big plays and winning games he said the packers then performed a miracle of their own they beat the bears suddenly and stunningly earthly

to the editor being texan i took great interest in of barbecue and men by brent staples the city life july 31 my 10 gallon hat goes off to mr staples for his dedication to the grill but that 's not why i wrote no i 'm afraid i have a much more serious concern mr staples was on the mark until he made the egregious and unfortunately all too common mistake of discussing barbecue sauce barbecue sauce despite its name has no place in barbecue the proof is evident if you have a perfectly grilled piece of meat the addition of sauce can only diminish it now i know this issue is debatable but being texan i do n't really need to justify my beliefs to anyone but my pappy so do not defile your barbecue with so called barbecue sauce your taste buds will thank you and your texan friends will shake your hand with a new enthusiasm ashley williams falls church va july 31 2003
representative richard a gephardt 's push to win the endorsement of the afl cio which is important to his hopes of winning the democratic presidential nomination has been set back by his problems raising money and his low standing in some polls many union leaders say mr gephardt of missouri has far more individual union endorsements than any of the other eight democratic candidates but to win the labor federation 's endorsement he needs the backing of unions representing two thirds of its 13 million members two thirds is a very tough and high mountain to climb said gerald w mcentee chairman of the afl cio 's political committee and president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees my own judgment is that right now he does n't have two thirds can he reach the two thirds it 's a possibility but i think it 's very challenging and difficult securing the afl cio 's endorsement before the primaries could give mr gephardt a major leg up political experts say because it would place at his disposal hundreds of union campaign workers already assigned to congressional districts across the nation all nine democratic presidential candidates are scheduled to debate tuesday in chicago before the afl cio 's executive council the council will not consider an endorsement this week federation officials say but mr gephardt 's backers hope that he can win the group 's endorsement at a meeting in october he very much would like the afl cio endorsement said steven elmendorf a senior adviser to the gephardt campaign even if we do n't get the endorsement a majority of unions will endorse gephardt he added there 's zero chance that any other candidate is going to get endorsed by the afl many union leaders question whether mr gephardt can obtain the needed two thirds majority hurting his chances several union presidents say is that three of the nation 's largest and most politically active unions the state county and municipal employees the service employees international union and the american federation of teachers appear unlikely to endorse mr gephardt any time soon the state county and municipal employees are leaning toward senator john kerry of massachusetts while the service employees and teachers say they are not ready to decide because they are still polling their members those unions represent nearly a third of the afl cio 's membership nine unions including the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the international union of bricklayers and allied craftworkers and the seafarers international union have already endorsed mr gephardt the unions that have endorsed him represented slightly more than one million members and then mr gephardt received a highly important endorsement friday when the executive board of the teamsters union which has 14 million members voted to support him bret caldwell the teamsters communications director said the union 's president james p hoffa would officially announce the endorsement in detroit next saturday mr hoffa will fly with mr gephardt to iowa the site of the first caucus and new hampshire the site of the first primary to speak on mr gephardt 's behalf a longtime union political official who insisted on anonymity said from the beginning there have been two schools of thought in the labor movement the gephardt loyalists and the pragmatists the pragmatists have been asking the question from the beginning can he win there is a reluctance some of them are pulling back a little bit certainly the money thing did n't help only two candidates have ever received the federation 's endorsement before the primaries vice president al gore in 2000 and walter mondale then a former vice president in 1984 when the decision was made to endorse gore who was a sitting vice president with him facing just one challenger it was still very tough to get to two thirds said steve rosenthal the afl cio 's former political director among union leaders there is a consensus that mr gephardt has the best record on labor issues that is one reason so many union leaders were concerned about his lackluster fund raising he raised just 38 million in the second quarter talking about mr gephardt 's fund raising bruce s raynor president of the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees said i would be less concerned about that than the question of the ability of a candidate to defeat george bush working families need george bush to be defeated we need a viable candidate to do that
congress 's main budget adviser has looked years into the future and concluded that the nation can not afford its overheated present as republicans continue cutting taxes enriching spending and rolling ever larger debts a decade over the horizon fiscal autopilot is not an option warned douglas holtz eakin director of the congressional budget office in a no nonsense estimate of serial budget imbalances to come unless the deficit and tax cut happy congress begins to put the brakes on now future americans will most likely be caught in an impossible crunch of historically higher taxes and plummeting health care and retirement benefits mr holtz eakin concluded in his forecast the cost of social security medicare and medicaid inevitably must eat up a sharply increasing chunk of the nation 's economic output as baby boomers retire and people live longer said mr holtz eakin a former bush adviser they will face more expensive health care with fewer active workers to help pay the escalating costs he said with short term economic indicators finally on the rebound no incumbent republican is likely to applaud these warnings they are about problems that will effectively reach a crisis beyond the careers of the very politicians who are most responsible for them but world markets in which the dollar is steadily declining against the euro are already showing a deepening suspicion about president bush 's policy of budgeting by deficit and debt congress should heed mr holtz eakin 's message that moving sooner is better than moving later
to the editor we should applaud leon botstein 's statement that the federal government has an important part to play in our overly localized system of public education op ed sept 19 but he misses the point that president clinton senator joseph i lieberman and others associated with the democratic leadership council have been trying to make new democrats would argue that a strong federal role can be combined with decentralized administration and local authority there are many ways the federal government can exercise leadership without trying to determine everything that goes on in the schools so let 's try to think anew without being limited by outmoded ideas about government philip selznick berkeley calif sept 19 2000 the writer is professor emeritus of law and sociology at the university of california at berkeley
to the editor regarding the article last sunday about the dobbs ferry village government 's barring nonresidents from parking at its metro north station commuter parking is a problem not only in ardsley and dobbs ferry but in most of westchester county i believe that this parking problem highlights the need for governments to require developers to submit transportation impact statements when proposing to build condominiums co ops or other housing the transportation impact statement should include provisions for shuttle bus or van service from the housing complex to a train or bus station if every new complex would offer residents transportation to a train or bus station we could avoid creating additional traffic congestion and metro north parking problems paul feiner town supervisor greenburgh
anna lindh who died early yesterday at the age of 46 after a stabbing attack was one of sweden 's most popular politicians a lifelong member of the governing social democrats she had been mentioned as a future party leader in 1998 when she became foreign minister under prime minister goran persson the swedish press called her persson 's crown princess seeing her as his likely successor she was vehemently pro european in a country where joining the european union was a heated issue she became the leading campaigner in the government 's drive to persuade a somewhat skeptical electorate to replace the swedish crown with the euro at the time of her death stockholm and indeed much of the country was plastered with posters picturing her under the word ja signifying the yes vote she favored in the referendum set for this weekend ms lindh supported the same causes embraced by swedish social democrats including environmental protection and human rights but she was unusually outspoken earlier this year during sweden 's six month presidency of the european union she called president bush a lone ranger for his decision to go to war in iraq without united nations approval although she expressed support for his campaign against global terror she clashed with the bush administration over other issues as well like its refusal to take part in the formation of the international criminal court she roundly criticized prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy for comparing a german lawmaker to a nazi concentration camp kapo and in an october 2001 interview with the times of india she succinctly laid out her government 's stance on the middle east insisting that israel remove settlements on the west bank withdraw military forces from the west bank and gaza strip anna maria lindh was born in stockholm on june 19 1957 and earned a law degree from the university of uppsala she was elected to parliament in 1982 and quickly rose through her party 's ranks becoming chairman of its youth league in 1984 and a member of the policy making executive committee in 1991 when the social democrats regained power in 1994 she was named environment minister she is survived by her husband bo holmberg also a politician and by their two sons david and filip

the national football league is pondering meeting with two lawyers who seek increases in head coaching opportunities for african americans the nfl received a letter from the lawyers late thursday night the letter was addressed to the commissioner but he was out of town a league official requesting anonymity said it is being reviewed we will respond sometime next week and it is possible that if the commissioner does not meet with them he will appoint someone in the league office to do so it could be the first step to avoid litigation on a sensitive and explosive issue for african american coaches the league 's management and its owners and players the lawyers johnnie cochran and cyrus mehri released a report last week called black coaches in the nfl superior performance inferior opportunities the report was developed by the labor economist janice madden from the university of pennsylvania and is supported by richard lapchick the race and sports authority and floyd keith executive director of the black coaches association among numerous findings the report said that african americans in the nfl were the last hired as head coaches and the first fired and that too few of them were involved in the interview process greg aiello the nfl 's vice president for public relations said the league had developed creative ways to address these issues realized their importance and welcomed constructive dialogue cochran said these numbers showed the need for substantive change before the nfl 's next head coaching hiring cycle which usually begins in january since 1920 the league has hired more than 400 head coaches and 6 of them 15 percent have been african american of the last 22 head coaching hires 2 have been african american and though african american players compose nearly 70 percent of the league the coordinators jobs are 72 percent white and 28 percent african american and the head coaching jobs are 94 percent white compared with 6 percent african american the league currently has 32 teams and two black head coaches cochran and mehri said they were not interested in quotas but specifically in the league 's interviewing more african americans for these vacancies they want commissioner paul tagliabue to use draft picks as a reward or penalty not only to provide incentive for owners to interview and hire more african american head coaches but also to diversify club front offices with more members of minority groups including women and hispanics aiello said that in the last five years nfl teams had interviewed 15 african americans for head coaching jobs a total of 23 times and 3 became head coaches they need a game plan for change because what they are doing is not working cochran said in the last three years it has gone backward not forward some of these owners have exhibited a mentality that they are not going to change unless you have a carrot stick concept tie this issue into draft picks and you will see results aiello said the league believed that because more african american assistant coaches are in the league than ever from that pool african american head coaches will emerge in 1980 he said the league had 14 black coaches in 1997 it had 103 with 5 of them coordinators and 3 of them head coaches it now has 154 and 12 are coordinators he said that from the league 's minority coaching internship program conducted during training camp 50 participants now have jobs as nfl coaches and one herman edwards is a head coach with the jets mehri said that the way the nfl states its position on the issue sounds similar to that of texaco and coca cola corporations against whom mehri won major race discrimination suits totaling nearly 368 million the nfl has been struggling with this issue regarding african american coaches over the years mehri said i 've been fighting for african americans in the corporate ranks where they have to fight hard to go half as far as their white counterparts when you see a denny green fired after the record he has built and then not get a new job or marvin lewis coach the best defense ever win a super bowl and two years later not have a head job you know that something is wrong the nfl is part of the epicenter of this country when kids today see so few african american head coaches what does that tell them the fans are being cheated a lot of african american coaches are better qualified than some of the people currently holding the job and our data shows that in a league where 70 percent of the players are african american someday those players are going to retire what does that mean to them when an option important to many of them is shut down you 've got one african american general manager in this league ozzie newsome in baltimore let 's empower the commissioner and create change or let the courts decide mehri said first mehri and cochran would like to help the league develop a plan that works otherwise apparently a suit will be filed in federal court in new york the nfl is not above the law mehri said but there is some arrogance there art modell the baltimore ravens owner said that if he listened to cochran he 'd have o j simpson coaching my team modell added we have a system in this league and color is not a factor this is such a competitive business and we want to get the one guy coaching our teams who can turn the juice on regardless of his color and i have a question since allie sherman coached the giants in the 60 's why have n't there been any jewish head coaches in the league what 's the difference this is like the middle linebackers the centers the coordinators and the quarterbacks in our league there are more african americans in those positions now and the wall has been brought down there are n't many african american coaches in the colleges right now but we 've had some growth in the numbers of our assistant coaches and coordinators it 's coming if it goes to court they 'll lose cochran responded why should these coaches have to wait why is it that a guy like sherman lewis experienced and successful sees one of the guys that used to report to him on the minnesota staff mike tice get a head coaching job in minnesota before he does there is a major glass ceiling and we want to negotiate a plan that creates constructive change before we litigate but we are prepared to litigate and we have the stamina resources and commitment to see this through
if a last minute provision in the senate farm bill becomes law irradiated hamburger could become known by a more appealing name pasteurized beef senator tom harkin the iowa democrat who heads the senate agriculture committee said today that he had inserted the provision in an effort to more clearly define pasteurization the process by which disease producing bacteria have long been destroyed in some foods through heating the harkin change would define irradiation as a kind of pasteurization it has been sought for several years by the growing irradiated food industry which argues that irradiation is a cold pasteurization and deserves to be referred to as such but neither the food and drug administration nor the agriculture department has yet to agree that meat treated by radiation a process approved by the government two years ago should qualify as pasteurized food safety advocates argue that the legislative provision is an effort to avoid fda regulatory procedures that would ordinarily be needed in order to define irradiation as a form of pasteurization for labeling purposes both the industry and mr harkin deny any such end run mr harkin 's home state is also home in sioux city to the main plant of the surebeam corporation the no 1 irradiator of ground beef sold in the united states he inserted the provision almost three weeks ago on the last day of senate debate on the farm bill the provision was later discovered by the public interest lobby public citizen in another late change mr harkin also inserted a clause that would forbid the agriculture secretary to keep irradiated food out of the school lunch program or any other federal nutrition program only the senate version of the bill includes those provisions the legislation is now in a house senate conference and it is uncertain whether the clauses will survive the two sides in the food safety debate agree that when consumers see irradiation on a label they often view it as a warning that the product has undergone a potentially dangerous process irradiation is something the consumer associates with wartime and bombs and bad things said diane toops food and trend editor of food processing a trade magazine that views irradiation favorably and since sept 11 the process has become associated with anthrax as well because irradiation is now used to kill germs in the postal system while mr harkin played down the effect of his last minute changes consumer advocates said the provision on irradiation 's definition could allow irradiated food to be labeled pasteurized without fda action under current regulations the label on irradiated meat must instead state that it has been treated by irradiation and must be marked with the symbol for irradiation called a radura it would be terrible just horrible misleading the public about what industry is doing to its food said joan claybrook president of public citizen wil williams spokesman for the surebeam corporation said that senator harkin was simply coming up with one standard definition and that surebeam had no intention of skirting the regulatory process irradiation is pasteurization partial sterilization to eliminate pathogens mr williams said all the farm bill does is come up with a standard everyone can use since irradiation was approved by the government two years ago he said it has been used to remove germs from millions of pounds of beef a spokesman for agriculture secretary ann m veneman had no comment on the harkin provisions

for those who pay attention to such things there is change afoot at the indian point nuclear plants correction make that the indian point energy center in the process of taking over the plants the entergy corporation has been replacing the nuclear part of the name with the more generic some might say more innocuous energy center a sign with the new title went up last fall outside the main entrance of the plants which are in buchanan about 35 miles north of midtown manhattan and in the past month the name has surfaced in a series of newspaper and radio advertisements intended to reassure the public about the safety of indian point 's nuclear operations in one recent newspaper ad for instance readers were urged to take confidence in the security of indian point energy center jim steets a spokesman for entergy said the name change reflected the company 's plan to eventually add a gas turbine to the site and to integrate what had been two separate nuclear plant operations under different owners entergy bought indian point 3 from the new york power authority in 2000 and indian point 2 from consolidated edison in september it was an important message to our employees that we were one site one team he said it was really about the integration of the sites rather than coming up with a name that was more palatable but some critics say that entergy is trying to downplay its nuclear operations in reaction to widespread concerns over safety since the sept 11 terror attacks corporations like to find ways to explain to people that castor oil is really honey said state assemblyman richard l brodsky this is the kind of thing that general electric tried to do with pcb 's in the hudson mr steets has denied any such motive calling the criticisms naive and overly suspicious indian point only means one thing to anyone who 's been involved or lived in westchester he said it was n't like we were trying to fool them into thinking we were a solar generated plant indian point is not the only nuclear plant seeking a makeover the millstone nuclear power station in waterford conn recently shortened its name to millstone power station while washington nuclear project 2 near richland wash was rechristened the columbia generating station among the other plants without a nuclear in sight is the susquehanna steam electric station near berwick pa it 's not unusual not to have nuclear in the name said diane screnci a spokeswoman for the federal nuclear regulatory commission but in the commission 's records at least the official name of the indian point plants remains the indian point nuclear generating unit 2 and unit 3 in the end of course a name change is just that a nuclear plant by any other name is still a nuclear plant harry di pietro 65 a storeowner in buchanan who supports nuclear energy said he would continue to call it just indian point i know what it is whatever they call it he said it does n't really matter what 's in a name anyway
ariel meyerowitz 580 broadway at prince street soho through jan 27 dr harold edgerton 's stop action photographs including the famous milk drop coronet remain enduring icons of modern experience yet why the world of art embraced edgerton 's originally purely scientific work is still a question worth pondering superficially this exhibition 's mostly small black and white vintage prints from 1935 to 1979 are simply informative records of events that happen too quickly for the naked eye to register you can see how all the muscles and tendons of a boxer 's arm stand out at the moment his fist hits the stationary bag you can study hummingbirds an owl or a bat arrested in mid flight as well as a popping balloon that has a wide open gash yet remains tautly inflated pictures that cumulatively record motion preserve the graceful trajectory of an athlete 's golf or squash swing or a pole vaulter 's leap from the perspective of art the appeal of edgerton 's images is in their perfectly composed lucidity and their surrealistic fusion of the factual and the miraculous the milk drop coronet the image of a glowing white crownlike form on a red field seen here in one of just two existing 1957 c prints made from the original negative is an uncannily beautiful image like the motion studies of eadweard muybridge in which the gridded repetition of the human figure suggests a metaphor about the subjection of humanity to technology edgerton 's images have acquired an emblematic aspect they have become symbols of a world in which the real is determined more and more by what machines rather than humans can perceive ken johnson

though the number of tuberculosis cases in the united states has fallen to an all time low a panel of experts called yesterday for renewed efforts to prevent the disease including screening immigrants for the dormant form of tb and tripling the financing for tuberculosis research there were just 17528 cases of active tuberculosis disease reported in the united states last year down from 18361 cases in 1998 and fully a third less than the recent peak of 26673 set in 1992 still according to a report from the institute of medicine of the national academies because tuberculosis remains widespread in many parts of the world the current decline in the united states could easily reverse us policy makers can not afford to relax their vigilance morton n swartz a professor at harvard medical school said dr swartz the chairman of the committee that wrote the report added that current efforts at tb control will not be sufficient and doing less could be disastrous the committee warned against a replay of the 1970 's when declining tb rates led to a dismantling of prevention and treatment programs a decade later in the late 1980 's tb infection rates rose again with drug resistant strains emerging part of the difficulty in eradicating tuberculosis is that the airborne bacteria that cause it can lie inactive in a person 's lungs for years with the host entirely unaware of the infection an estimated 90 percent of people infected by the bacteria never develop the active form of the disease which can cause a persistent cough chest pain fatigue and fever the report urges new efforts at detecting latent tuberculosis infections particularly among immigrants though immigrants account for only 10 percent of the united states population they constitute about 40 percent of active tuberculosis cases it recommended that immigrants from countries with high incidence of the disease mostly in asia and africa be screened for latent tuberculosis infections those who tested positive would still be allowed to enter the united states but would have to undergo evaluation and antibiotic therapy before they could get a permanent residency card the study was financed by the federal centers for disease control and prevention the institute of medicine is a private nonprofit institution that provides advice on health policy under a congressional charter to the national academy of sciences
directed by kristen coury not rated 87 minutes friends and family an independent feature directed by kristen coury and written by joseph triebwasser tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of american farce the mafia comedies epitomized by harold ramis 's analyze this 1999 and the long string of gay coming out comedies that probably peaked around the time of mike nichols 's birdcage 1996 but both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further and friends and family quickly collapses into an overloaded slow moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations greg lauren and christopher gartin are respectively stephen and danny a pair of model handsome gay men who live in a tastefully appointed town house on stuyvesant street in the east village they support their cole porter lifestyle by working improbably as coldblooded enforcers for the mob the film which opens today in new york begins with an unpleasant sequence in which during an intermission at the opera they dash backstage clad in their perfect tuxedos to shake down a tenor who has been late in paying his gambling debts the men come off as little more than well spoken thugs but the moral issues do n't seem to have concerned or even to have occurred to ms coury who finds them endearing a cuddly update of leopold and loeb it 's meant to be hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any professional leg breaker and the movie 's central joke is that stephen and danny are much more efficient masters of violence than vito daniel mastrogiorgio and frankie lou carbonneau the two excessively gentle sons of the mafia boss don patrizzi tony lo bianco vito and frankie are n't gay it seems just heavily into cooking and sewing but while stephen and danny are out both to their don and to their parents they have n't told stephen 's midwestern parents beth fowler and frank pellegrino what it is they do for a living this causes complication when stephen 's mom and dad decide to drop in for a surprise visit expecting to find stephen and danny in charge of a successful catering business the surprise visit from the straight world is a staple of this kind of comedy but here instead of pretending to be heterosexuals the two protagonists must assume some ancient mincing gay stereotypes enlisting some of their fellow hit men all traditionally macho beefy brooklyn types to prance around as gay waiters they put on a dinner for their visitors that doubles for reasons best known to the screenwriter as an engagement dinner for the mafia boss 's daughter rebecca creskoff she too has a prospective in law problem her fiance 's parents are a pair of right wing militants tovah feldshuh and brian lane green who see their trip to new york as a chance to initiate a guerrilla war against the federal government with too many characters interacting in too many ways the film feels crowded confused and unproductively frenetic dave kehr
to the editor president bush faces a dilemma over the pentagon memo barring companies from france germany and russia from bidding on iraq reconstruction allies angered at exclusion from bidding news article dec 11 not to worry because at this rate they wo n't be allies much longer nathalie guyol waxahachie tex dec 11 2003
the united states central command combat surveillance video showed an iraqi military vehicle hiding beneath a bridge a smart bomb glided in from the right destroying the vehicle but leaving the bridge intact then came a surveillance picture of iraqi military communications equipment atop a building within some 2000 year old ruins on the bank of the tigris river a historic site recognized by the united nations in that case american commanders decided not to strike these two targets and the opposite decisions made as to whether to attack illustrate the complicated task given to american war planners who are charged with destroying a government but not a country the military mission calls for coalition forces to topple saddam hussein and rid his nation of any weapons of mass destruction that may be hidden there at the same time the war plan calls for leaving as much iraqi infrastructure as possible standing to ease postwar reconstruction and to minimize civilian deaths in order to quiet angry public opinion as the war enters its second week however military affairs experts ponder whether more indiscriminate bombing might in the end hasten victory and save the lives of american troops and even spare more iraqis the pain of a grinding ground war we decided we would restrain the use of air power for reasons of humanity and world image said loren thompson an air power expert at the lexington institute a policy research center here we have imposed a burden on our campaign plan that may slow down victory and diminish the quality of the victory we achieve american generals can ratchet up the violence delivered by air with just a command mr thompson noted and they are expected to do so as american ground forces move to face republican guard troops encircling baghdad the question is what measure of risk of civilian casualties and damage to buildings like hospitals and schools will be considered acceptable in order to secure a speedier victory this quandary has been placed upon american commanders by mr hussein who has ordered his forces arrayed in neighborhoods even using hospitals as garrisons according to pentagon officials the mantra heard at almost every wartime news conference held by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld or gen tommy r franks the senior commander for the war and his subordinates is that the american military will continue its efforts to exercise extreme prudence in choosing and attacking targets in order to minimize civilian deaths and damage to public works we have a very very deliberate process for targeting brig gen vincent brooks deputy director of operations for the united states central command said during a briefing in qatar today it 's unlike any other targeting process in the world it takes into account all science it takes into account all capability and we do everything physically and scientifically possible to be precise in our targeting and also to minimize secondary effects whether it 's on people or on structures but the second guessing is well under way selective bombing is wrongheaded perpetuating the regime causes more casualties certainly among iraqi troops than 'collateral damage would edward n luttwak a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary published by the los angeles times today even as some military experts in the academic world suggest that more intense bombing be considered today kofi annan the united nations secretary general became the latest international leader to serve notice that the united states will suffer far reaching consequences if it starts hitting targets that kill civilians and destroy infrastructure mr annan 's comments came as american officials reacted cautiously to reports that a marketplace in baghdad had been damaged by an explosion that left 14 people dead at the pentagon maj gen stanley mcchrystal said american forces had not aimed any ordnance at that neighborhood in the iraqi capital while officials could not absolutely rule out a hit by an errant american bomb or missile they also said the explosion might have been caused by iraqi antiaircraft fire falling back to earth or a faulty iraqi missile we do know for a fact that something landed in the shaab district general mcchrystal said but we do not know if it was us or iraqi we do know that we did not target anything in the vicinity proponents of air power have argued almost since the invention of the modern warplane that victory can be achieved through the air by attacking enemy leaders communications and the centers of gravity that prop up their governments for this war with iraq the air campaign had been planned to open the offensive and set the stage for the ground attack but that sequence had to be reversed after president bush ordered the surprise missile strike last wednesday in an effort to kill mr hussein and top iraqi leaders general mcchrystal said that since the war began more than 600 cruise missiles and 4300 other precision guided munitions have been launched at iraq but a week into the war air power experts acknowledge that the pentagon 's current bomb and missile campaign failed to deliver a quick knockout blow though that could still happen in recent days the air campaign shifted from mostly planned strikes against leadership targets and command or communications centers to attacks on iraq 's forces in the field specifically the republican guard divisions any analysis of the air campaign by anyone outside the most senior military commands and civilian leadership is naturally based on a hodgepodge of television images scattered witness reports from the front and a sense of history many of the effects of air operations are cumulative said eliot a cohen a professor at johns hopkins university who directed the air force 's definitive study of the first war against iraq at any given time you may think you 're not doing very much but suddenly when the right pressures come together the other guy collapses but he cautioned that the public 's view of the air war is opaque at best
to the editor as a practicing catholic i readily concur with paul e dinter 's description of american catholicism today op ed jan 1 the solution to our difficulties is to replace our monarchical church governance model with a democratic one unfortunately that would require us to go from the middle ages to the 21st century not an easy task chuck zannetti sacramento jan 1 2003
i was in my second year of college when i dropped out to chase a boy over to europe i hardly knew him the idle rumor that he had once said he liked me provided enough spark to ignite the journey carefully i laid my plans i wrote my parents of my unhappiness with school the lack of challenge my need for a break i scrounged the air fare i found a job waiting tables in a ski hotel outside innsbruck crammed berlitz german then dropped the fellow a casual line where he was studying in vienna i happened to be on the continent i wrote in case he was n't doing much and could use a traveling companion did it work gentle reader i fear it did in her travel writer 's romance my dream of you the irish novelist nuala o'faolain writes right at the end of my mind there was a golden blur this blur was love or hugo or passion no matter what i was thinking or doing talking to a boy in the queue and letting him buy me a cup of coffee reading the wonderfully glamorous place names on the sides of the wagons lit carriages on the platform at calais all the time the center of me was immobile rapt in front of that golden light when i count how many times i have enlisted travel in the service of that light i blush with the shame of a lesson unlearned several lessons in fact for there is traveling to find love traveling to fix love and traveling to feed love and each works on the heart in mysterious ways once i had landed my college quarry we joined forces to trace the castle building adventures of mad king ludwig we roamed up to berlin and back down to munich in a foggy black forest he taught me to whistle the only gift he gave me our sleeping arrangements ran the gamut from separate men 's and women 's hostel quarters to the narrow lobby benches of a sold out hotel in sold out frankfurt to a shared feather bed near mozart 's birthplace in salzburg like victor hugo 's daughter adele who followed an indifferent french officer to the new world i traveled with hope in my luggage every morning i woke believing the bright tulips or the crusty strudel would unlock the door to romance and then i lost him having run low on funds i bid my beloved auf wiedersehen and let him take a solo trip to prague while i earned a few more tips and planned to meet him a week later in amsterdam i knew somehow as the train chugged out of sight that i would never see this wayward boy again and i thought then that the whole trip had been a terrible waste of my time my money my passion if salzburg could n't get a man to fall in love with you i reasoned what could traveling to find love may not always be a doomed prospect my cousin mimi met her husband eurailing and any number of cruises use the possibility of shipboard romance as a chief draw but traveling to fix love surely is before the wedding my first husband and i made a pact that we would see italy together the image of the two of us sipping chianti high in the abruzzi sustained us through those early years when we had to content ourselves with a weekend backpacking expedition or a night out in little italy how happy we would be in florence regarding the david what bliss we would discover in a midnight gondola alas by the time we booked the tickets we were drifting apart we could scarcely agree on a brand of toothpaste much less an itinerary still we arrived at what we thought was a healing arrangement since he had a trust fund he would pay for the trip since i spoke italian i would be guide and interpreter this symbiosis along with the mediterranean sun and ripe olives would reheat our passion but we realized with a growing sense of guilt that the flame had died florence irritated us as if the city 's buoyant nature were to blame for our ennui as we browsed the uffizi our eyes wandered all the beds seemed too narrow the breakfasts too cold he tried hard not to complain about cost i tried harder not to complain about linguistic incompetence in the end we took separate flights home at the edges of these depressing scenes luckily glimmers another sort of romance when i look back on my college escapade i can hardly see the face of the young man toward whom i thought i was traveling what comes to mind instead are the shoulder high banks of snow on the alpine paths the chandeliers at the hotel sacher the heart stopping funicular ride up to garmisch partenkirchen the night before the object of my affection first found me in the village where i was waitressing my boss gave us the night off and the whole staff of the hotel slid downhill to the village polka dance where the postmaster bought me a dark beer and i was spun around the room in a giddy whirl of oompahs and lederhosen likewise my swan song trip to italy afforded me the pleasure of picnicking among sunlit ruins with the peculiar scents of goat cheese and warm stone as a means to get or keep love these journeys were dismal as forays through the world and back to the self they fulfilled their promise after all many travelers women particularly strike up liaisons simply for the companionship of the road who can say that romance even when it fires the blood is not simply a catalyst for seeing the world more intensely for oneself even adele hugo had she regained her presence of mind might have looked past her caddish officer to the sublime highlands of cape breton the swirling colors of barbados which brings me to my final category though trying to wring love out of travel seems a doomed effort traveling when in love can prove nourishing after all you hardly care where you go so long as you go there together time loses meaning a missed train is an opportunity on my second honeymoon we had trouble getting out of the house a friend had lent us in versailles when we finally decamped for mont st michel we both felt the need to shake love 's laziness and get some fresh french air so we rented a pair of squat bicycles the next day we set off along the scenic coast and in what seemed the blink of an eye we reached historic avranches where we ate tartines and cooled off in the town 's sparkling swimming pool then we turned south how we had not noticed that the trip was more than 12 miles each way that it was mostly hilly that the winds blew hard from the west that our bicycle seats were each six inches too low for good pedaling that i had developed a blister or that a storm front was moving in only cupid can say for a time we took refuge in an allied graveyard then soaked and shivering our thighs cramping we hobbled and creaked the final kilometers until my husband 's front tire blew and we walked that night there was plenty of tlc and no room for blame i never want to see avranches again but every time we recall that disastrous bicycle ride one or the other of us gets a hug they coexist uneasily the urge to explore and the urge to entwine but i am not ready altogether to set them apart essay lucy ferriss 's most recent novel is nerves of the heart university

jimmy fleming has pinpoint vision and short term memory problems his right hand shakes involuntarily he also has a sense of humor and a desire to share his story that story is about his bicycle accident on july 10 1985 mr fleming then 10 years old was out riding with a friend on his way to get some ice cream when he was hit by a car he flew up in the air as high as the telephone wires fell on the windshield and flipped over the back of the car landing on his head mr fleming was in a coma for 16 weeks and was totally blind for two years if he had worn a helmet his head injuries would have been far less severe which is why mr fleming who lives in pleasantville has spent the last five years going to schools boy scout and girl scout meetings and other places where children gather around westchester county promoting helmet safety for bicyclists skateboarders rollerbladers and skiers part lecture part stand up mr fleming 's 20 minute program resembles something you might see on the david letterman show it 's my way of lightening the mood a little said mr fleming who recently took his act to the northern westchester center for the arts where he studies theater quite frankly without a sense of humor my life would have been miserable q you interject jokes into your program have you been criticized for this a no i never make jokes about head injuries or undermine the importance of wearing helmets there 's nothing funny about these things at all i enjoy making people laugh i always have even before the accident my feeling is that if i just stood up and said to the kids you should wear your helmet because it reduces the risk of head injuries by 85 percent or it 's the law they 'd listen and say ok whatever when they hear me talk about my experience they appreciate the fact that i 'm not cynical or bitter and that i have a sense of humor in spite of it all the kids have remarked to me you have such courage and strength i get strength from hearing that q what sort of things do you talk about during your program a at one school i asked the kids to close their eyes for five minutes i asked them to keep them closed and do n't open them when five minutes was up i said now you can open your eyes i asked them what they saw they said nothing i told them that that is what i saw for two years i also tell them to look up at the telephone wires for a minute i say to them that is how high up i was when i was thrown from my bicycle that makes a big impact on them i like to talk about things that scare them then it will mean something q how do you know you 're making an impact on these kids a several years ago i went to the grand union with my dad he said to me jimmy wait right here i 'm waiting for my dad and this kid comes running up to me he told me he was in a bike accident a few weeks ago he said that if he had n't heard my talk he probably would n't have been wearing a helmet he wanted to thank me when i think about my accident i realize there are a few negatives but i also realize there are some positives hearing things like what this boy said are the positives q talk about this talent you have with letters and numbers a i honestly do n't know where that came from it happened after my brain was injured i can identify the letters of the alphabet by their numbers so anytime people tell me their names i see them in their number form i can do this automatically without even thinking about it i do this at the schools and the kids love it q people are constantly saying to you how do you keep your spirits up what do you say to that a my mom said that to me a lot after the accident she said jimmy how do you do it you make it so easy on me i say i just consider the alternative
seeming ever more frail pope john paul ii beatified mother teresa of calcutta on sunday as an icon of the good samaritan declaring her close to sainthood before tens of thousands of worshipers in st peter 's square the two hour ceremony said as much about the pope 's vitality though as it did about the memory of mother teresa whose image of devotion to the sick and needy has become an emblem of selflessness and piety with our apostolic authority we grant that the venerable servant of god teresa of calcutta shall from now on be called blessed the pope said in latin his voice was halting and indistinct as he pronounced mother teresa the latest of the more than 1300 people he has beatified in his 25 year tenure a huge portrait of mother teresa a nobel peace prize winner sometimes called the saint of the gutters for her work in calcutta was unfurled on the great facade of st peter 's basilica showing her smiling and deeply wrinkled her greatness lies in her ability to give without counting the cost to give 'until it hurts the pope 's homily said her life was a radical living and a bold proclamation of the gospel i am personally grateful to this brave woman who i always felt was at my side the sermon said though the words illuminated the pope 's feeling for mother teresa 's example the manner of their delivery betrayed his frailty for the first time on a major occasion the pope did not read a single line of his homily leaving it to cardinal ivan dias of bombay and others to speak for him when he said prayers in latin moreover his voice slurred to the point where his words were hard to understand senior aides also took over from him in saying mass when his voice weakened and tailed off people who have watched him closely in recent years said that the pope seemed particularly tired perhaps because he is midway through an intense series of public appearances those began with the celebrations of his quarter century as pope last thursday and are set to culminate on tuesday in the confirmation of 31 new cardinals the ceremonies on sunday blended the vatican 's solemnity with less austere moments indian women in white and gold saris bearing flowers swayed before the canopied altar on the steps of st peter 's basilica to music played on tabla and harmonium within the huge crowd said by the police to number 300000 although other estimates put the figure lower some people lauded the pope 's courage in defying the increasingly evident symptoms of parkinson 's disease others saw the remarkable spectacle of his physical decline as inspirational from his suffering and his humanity we can see his holiness said elena pelli a 19 year old italian law student in bright sunlight after a night of rain the pope was wheeled to an altar below the basilica on an upholstered chair and after the ceremony seemed to rally slightly as he was driven through the crowd in an open popemobile with few of the security trappings that usually surround figures of global stature beatification may be granted by the roman catholic church to a person who is seen as having been of overwhelming virtue whose goodness has been sustained after death and who is deemed to have interceded from beyond the grave in a miracle usually a medical cure for which there is said to be no scientific explanation once beatified the blessed and relics associated with them may be venerated the pope was presented on sunday with a piece of cloth stained with mother teresa 's blood that is to be displayed this week in a roman church for veneration beatification usually leads to sainthood once there is evidence of a second miracle mother teresa was born in 1910 in skopje now the capital of macedonia a former yugoslav republic she died in 1997 after spending most of her life in calcutta living in poverty as she ministered to the poorest and least privileged she founded her order the missionaries of charity in 1950 with 12 nuns it now has 4500 sisters in more than 130 countries like mother teresa the nuns wear the simple white saris edged in blue that were once associated with the street sweepers of calcutta from the earliest hours on sunday people began gathering in st peter 's square and along the wide via della conciliazione leading to it some brought their own sick in wheelchairs hoping for miracles others relished the sense of occasion that vatican officials are skilled at building among the crowd many waved red and black albanian flags to honor mother teresa 's origins although the claim to her memory is disputed between albanian and macedonian nationalists presidents princes dignitaries and politicians from 27 countries including the united states attended the open air ceremony the week of ecclesiastical events surrounding the beatification has been closely choreographed to ensure its impact not only do the church 's scarlet robed cardinals lend a sense of gravity and occasion but the timing of mother teresa 's beatification which drew bigger numbers than the pope 's own anniversary mass on thursday virtually assured that pilgrims would flood here from around the world this is like witnessing the faith of so many people said cathy o'donnell 48 who had traveled from stephens city va some in the crowd said they believed the pope had scheduled the events so close together because he sensed that time was running out perla godino 21 an italian art student said he is a great pope who wants to do things in his way and added he is bringing his mission to its completion pope john paul ii 's papacy has set records not only for beatifications but also for sainthoods the pope has canonized more than 470 new saints since he took office those who gathered for the ceremony dismissed suggestions by the pope 's critics that he had bent the church 's rules by permitting mother teresa 's supporters to complete the processes leading to beatification so soon after her death usually five years must elapse before the process begins but the pope waived that requirement for mother teresa and approved a miracle last year curing an indian woman of a tumor said to be cancerous that some held to be contentious she was already a saint said lucielle hoyon 56 of paris
to the editor a may 24 letter writer takes umbrage at the simon schuster executive who promoting electronic books referred to a book as a container the writer says the book should be respected as an object of value and beauty in itself the writer might consider the difference between a painting which embodies art and a book which copies it destroy the painting and the art is gone destroy a particular volume and the art is unaffected an identical replacement sits on the shelf at your local bookstore so much is reflected in the conventional usage that a writer sells copies as a book collector i know that copies can be beautifully printed and bound and that one can become attached to these customary physical trappings but confusing the contents with the container risks missing the advantages that a new delivery system might promise true book lovers will appreciate any system that augments their enjoyment of the art and there are situations in which the electronic reader does that dramatically william r andersen seattle may 24 2000
as democratic chief of staff on the senate finance committee lawrence o'donnell jr spent a lot of time sitting through important congressional meetings but his agenda was a bit different from everyone else 's i would take two different kinds of notes mr o'donnell said one set related to the policy we were working on in the room and the other was about the atmospherics that were going on i always knew i 'd be leaving government someday i just did n't know when there was something about knowing that it was temporary that left me in writerly observational mode the first set of notes came in handy while mr o'donnell held the finance post from 1993 to 1995 the second set though continues to pay dividends as mr o'donnell channels the information into mister sterling which had its premiere this month the new nbc series centers on the trials and tribulations of an idealistic young lawyer josh brolin who also happens to be the son of william sterling a popular ex governor of california played by james whitmore when one of the state 's senators dies suddenly the younger mr sterling is unexpectedly given the temporary appointment to take his place the series may be a modern more issue oriented version of mr smith goes to washington but mr o'donnell who first began writing the show in 1992 and is one of its executive producers says it 's not strictly about politics this is a show in which the lead character 's first statement about politics is 'i hate politics he said right there we 're welcoming in viewers who do n't like politics this show is n't c span it 's about human drama and conflict we wo n't stay locked in congressional offices nbc executives also maintain that even though this is the network 's second show involving politicians mister sterling has very little in common with the west wing the emmy award winning series on which mr o'donnell previously worked as a writer and producer we felt like our schedule can support two shows like this said karey burke executive vice president for development of prime time series at nbc after all you can have different kinds of cop shows and different kinds of doctor shows why not different kinds of politician shows and mister sterling certainly tries to make its title character different rather than be a dyed in the wool democrat a la president bartlet on west wing mr sterling is a devout independent he supports oil drilling in alaska but also wants money to hire teachers for inmates he hops from one side of the fence to another depending on the issue something that mr o'donnell and the network hope will more accurately reflect how most americans and their elected officials really think the truth is even people who work within the parties are much more independent in private thinking than their public postures indicate mr o'donnell said they all have a list of things they dislike about what their parties are doing and that includes mr brolin the son of the actor james brolin and stepson of the decidedly democratic barbra streisand mr brolin was initially reluctant to take the role of mr sterling because he feared the show would be too partisan after meeting with mr o'donnell though he quickly changed his mind i was the kid with the mohawk growing up i was n't alec baldwin he said i do n't care about politics i vote and get involved when i need to i do it personally i would n't hire me to play a senator because i 'm not typical but lawrence wanted somebody who goes against the grain the notion of a truly independent united states senator let alone one with mr brolin 's movie star good looks is certainly not indicative of what americans have come to expect from their congressional representatives i do n't know if 'the west wing is really like the way politics is in this country but this show is fiction and can be idealistic mr brolin said but he added what you see on the show is not not possible it 's that fantasy element that really hooked the network it 's the same thing we saw with 'er ms burke said those were the doctors you wished could treat you with 'mister sterling these characters are the people we wish had these jobs in washington in real life but mr o'donnell though admitting to moments in every episode when he 'd think gee i 'd like to see things done this way in real life considers the series a pretty realistic depiction of the limits of power i 'm not trying to teach any lessons he said that might happen and i 'd be open to the possibility that people will say 'oh he 's trying to say this about that policy but that 's not what 's consciously driving my writing mr o'donnell does not think of mister sterling as particularly democratic or liberal he prefers to use another term activist i think this would be a little problematic dramatically if you tried to make a show about a conservative and the republicans would probably agree he said they want to do less in government and that 's a trickier thing to go at in drama how does a scene work when your character is the guy who does n't want to do something it 's a trickier thing trying to find the drama in that so for a tv show being activist is a good thing political correctness does n't hurt either the part of mr sterling 's chief of staff was n't written for an african american woman and at first that 's what kept audra mcdonald from auditioning for it i was protecting myself from disappointment said ms mcdonald who is best known for her award winning broadway performances i thought it was a great script but figured they 'd never cast me because i 'm black but everyone there really pushed for me because the thinking is very open minded for a tv show while mr o'donnell and the network do n't want to push politics too hard ms mcdonald said she was confident that audiences would be getting a civics lesson i hope we have an effect on people she said i 'd like this show to advance really good ideas and make people more aware of their own voice that 's certainly not out of the realm of possibility according to ms burke after 'er went on the air i heard that medical school enrollment started going up she said cover story craig tomashoff is a television critic

the funny thing about the university of okoboji winter games has always been that there is no university this year there was no winter but the games must go on in sleet in snow and yes even in sunshine so instead of parking cars on smith 's bay where the ice this weekend was about 8 inches thick instead of the typical 40 organizers used a dirt lot on the shores of west lake okoboji a

to the editor paul krugman column feb 27 suggests that market indexes like the dow jones industrial average are irrelevant for long term investors because the successful companies of the future may not even exist yet and are therefore unrepresented in any market index he says if you buy the dow you only buy a claim on the future earnings of the companies currently in the index that 's not a trivial distinction mr krugman is correct if i invest directly in the companies that make up the dow but if i invest using a mutual fund a fund tracking the dow gives me a stake in all the companies in the dow for as long as i hold it hence a long term investor need not speculate on the success of companies unborn he must predict only the index they will appear in andrew g biggs washington feb 28 2000 the writer is an analyst at the cato institute
when senator john mccain had a routine checkup for skin cancer on july 27 a few days before the republican convention dr john f eisold the attending physician of the united states capitol spotted a mole on his patient 's left temple and told him you ought to have that checked the checkup was one of many regular exams mr mccain has undergone since he had a malignant melanoma removed from his left shoulder in 1993 the doctors had pronounced him cured of that melanoma but it is too soon to know how serious the new one on his temple will be after the recent checkup mr mccain moved swiftly on aug 1 after speaking at the convention in philadelphia the senator took the train to washington two days later he went to bethesda naval medical center in maryland where doctors detected another suspicious mole on his left upper arm and performed a biopsy on each mole that evening mr mccain returned to the convention and wore a bandage over part of his left temple when he appeared on stage with gov george w bush the republican presidential nominee a week later on aug 10 mr mccain learned in a call from bethesda that the moles were new malignant melanomas mr mccain who later said he was surprised by the diagnosis then arranged to have a second opinion and additional tests performed through dr john d eckstein his personal physician at the mayo clinic here on saturday mr mccain had a five and a half hour operation to remove the two melanomas and lymph nodes in his head and neck today as mr mccain 63 recovers at the mayo clinic hospital here he is awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the temple melanoma has spread preliminary tests before and during surgery indicated that the cancer was confined to the skin his doctors said the quickness with which mr mccain and his doctors reacted in the last three weeks contrasts sharply with a similar situation in 1993 at that time it took more than six months before mr mccain sought care after a navy doctor recommended that he consult a dermatologist for what turned out to be his first melanoma the one removed from his left shoulder mr mccain 's experience with the more than six month delay in 1993 led him to act much faster this time and the episode in 1993 underlies the senator 's repeated urging that other people get checked for skin cancer for instance mr mccain stood in front of his home on friday after undergoing tests at the hospital to emphasize the benefits of detecting melanomas and other cancers at an early stage when they are most curable the delay in 1993 was documented in the hundreds of pages of medical records mr mccain released during the presidential primary campaign and was verified in interviews with his doctors the records included the annual checkups that mr mccain underwent as a volunteer in the program for all former prisoners of war that the military conducts in pensacola fla the pensacola doctors spotted a dark irregularly shaped area of skin on mr mccain 's left shoulder during a checkup on may 7 1993 but the records show they did not suspect a melanoma a letter from a navy doctor dated june 8 1993 recommended that mr mccain consult a dermatologist for what the pensacola doctors said they thought was a noncancerous condition actinic keratosis which results from chronic sun exposure it was not until nov 24 1993 that mr mccain sought care for the skin condition he went to dr thomas m hudak a plastic surgeon in phoenix who had treated mr mccain 's wife cindy dr hudak said in an earlier interview that though the dark area on the skin was not an obvious melanoma he suspected it was a cancer after years of seeing many lesions like this it just sort of caught my eye dr hudak said the melanoma had escaped the eye of dr eckstein mr mccain 's personal physician who said in an interview that he did n't recognize it if it was there when he examined mr mccain in 1992 undoubtedly it was there dr eckstein said the reasons for the delay in 1993 are not clear now said nancy ives mr mccain 's press secretary but ms ives said that mr mccain might have put off seeking medical care in part because of a heavy speaking schedule on behalf of other republicans because individuals with one melanoma can develop more they are advised to have periodic checkups dr hudak said he had removed several noncancerous moles from mr mccain 's skin including one from his left temple on oct 4 1998 it was a type known as a pigmented junctional nevus mr mccain recalled on friday that the new melanoma appeared near the spot where the benign mole had been melanomas can occasionally go undetected in a biopsy for many reasons one is misdiagnosis a second reason is disagreement among pathologists in interpreting what they see through a microscope if you send slides of a suspected melanoma to a dozen dermatologists some will call it normal and some will read it as a melanoma said dr bernard s goffe a dermatologist in seattle that 's a well known fact a third reason is that pathologists do not examine every millimeter of the tissue removed in a biopsy they take representative sections from different areas thus a melanoma that is confined to a small area of a mole may escape examination as a result of sampling errors when a new melanoma is detected in an area where a mole was removed and diagnosed as benign doctors usually review the microscopic slides to determine if the melanoma was present but missed in the initial testing dr eckstein said on saturday that no evidence of a melanoma had been detected in such a review of the mole that was removed from mr mccain in 1998 even early detection of melanomas is not foolproof because such cancers can be quirky recurring suddenly and unexpectedly decades after they are first detected yet when such metastases have occurred many people have gone on for years without further medical problems and sometimes a melanoma can first develop in the bowel or brain without ever having appeared on the skin scientists do not know why melanomas can behave so peculiarly

sometimes success in television turns to failure faster than a teenager can change channels this is an especially painful truth at vh1 these days once a cultural force for baby boomers vh1 is not just a fading music channel with a ratings slide it has become a major worry for viacom its parent company that is why viacom has brought in the mtv programming president brian graden a cable wunderkind known to have an uncanny eye for hit programs it hopes he will be able to pull off the delicate balancing act of trying to reach what it considers the ideal broad vh1 audience those in their mid 20 's who have graduated beyond the pierced bubble gum pop of mtv through those who remember swimming in the mud of woodstock the first time industry executives will be watching closely mr graden 's touch in the late 1990 's brought new hits to basic cable that broke the old rules with raw anything goes humor and ultimately pushed the barriers of taste for all television when the pop culture history of the last decade is written it will certainly not leave out graden backed projects like south park on comedy central and jackass and the osbournes at mtv a lot is riding on the continued success of mr graden 's golden instincts for viacom in the last two years vh1 an important revenue generator has failed to develop any new hits instead relying on old shows like behind the music the biography program about rock stars from days gone by 80 's sensations milli vanilli motley crue def leppard in the meantime its average audience decreased more than 20 percent in the past year to 200000 people last quarter with even worse dips in key demographic categories some weeks that has cost viacom tens of millions of dollars in rebates to advertisers who did not reach as large an audience as vh1 had promised and were compensated with free spots with so much advertising time filled with those give backs vh1 ran out of room to accommodate everyone viacom was forced to find time on its healthier networks like mtv and tnn officials said mel karmazin the president of viacom was not pleased suddenly one of viacom 's proudest assets had become a serious liability even as its younger skewing music channel sibling mtv climbed to historic highs there is wide consensus in the television industry that mr graden with help from vh1 's new general manager christina norman is the right person to right the ship his responsibilities were extended to vh1 last week by judy mcgrath the mtv networks music group president who took charge of vh1 when john sykes the former vh1 president was put in charge of infinity radio in march mr graden effectively replaces fred graver head vh1 programmer for a year there is considerable fear within mtv networks that mr graden a harvard mba may be spread too thin and that the division of his attention could hurt both vh1 and mtv but that seems to be counterbalanced by general impatience for a recovery at vh1 it 's a drag on everybody said one viacom executive ms mcgrath said mtv was humming along so well that mr graden would have ample time to focus on his new charge people inside and outside viacom often take jabs at vh1 referring to the cobwebs hanging on the behind the music and before they were rock stars franchises and blame an over reliance on those shows for vh1 's problems they just basically ran their hits into the ground said larry gerbrandt chief content officer of kagan world media a media research firm but current and former viacom executives said that after so many years building a rock solid brand identity for vh1 its leadership erred recently in trying to make the network so long considered a haven for baby boomers more narrowly focused on the hipper younger members of generation x those in their late 20 's to mid 30 's taking aim at generation x had its own difficulties some at vh1 felt it was dangerous to put so much emphasis on a younger demographic that considered it a network for older people while risking the alienation of its more mature core many at viacom felt the team spent too much time wringing hands about the target audience and not enough time making television supporters of mr graver said he was not given enough time to make things work none of the four new programs introduced in march including a nighttime talk show late world with zach and a music trivia show called never mind the buzzcocks generated much attention or ratings mr graden now has his work cut out for him to reach what is jokingly referred to as the new vh1 target people with eyeballs he has been here before he found mtv in a similar position when he arrived there in 1997 with mtv riding on the strength of programs like real world but little else it was bleeding ratings and revenues they were in a little bit of a calamity he said in a telephone interview people would say 'if we were just cooler more people would watch there was too much concern about marketing and not enough about programming he added mr graden said he quickly began to apply his formula it does not include any grand vision he says he casts aside focus group research and follows his instincts assigning a team to produce inexpensive experimental pilots freely and keeping an open mind to their ideas like following the family of an aging rock star the osbournes or showing someone stun himself with a taser gun jackass i believe in constantly being open and never thinking you know too much he said sometimes the good ideas are the ones that borrow nothing from the world before them if somebody came in a year ago and pitched ozzy osbourne as the next big thing on paper nobody would have bought that before he started at mtv mr graden was already somewhat of a cable legend as a young executive at the news corporation 's foxlabs experimental programming studio in the mid 1990 's he discovered the hit young animators matt stone and trey parker to keep them in his fold he gave them 2000 to create a video christmas card for him featuring the characters of what is now south park that made the rounds in hollywood eventually to become south park on comedy central of course what appeals to an mtv audience that includes teenage girls and fraternity boys will not necessarily appeal to the more grown up vh1 audience mr graden acknowledges that he is being asked to draw a broader audience than that of mtv but his biggest hits like the osbournes and south park have appealed to people of all ages he said he would seek programs he considered funny or insightful or touching and hope his tastes squared with those of the audience you ca n't be that precious about it he said my job is to find that universal emotional connection he said he believed his instincts would be on the mark at vh1 because just like many in the vh1 audience his tastes are maturing beyond mtv at some point i 'll grow out of it and i 'll just program vh1 he said and after that i 'll go program the aarp channel

most music fans congregating in napster 's chat rooms yesterday afternoon were seeking an answer to a simple question as anongirl put it succinctly how long do we have besides setting off a stampede to download free music before it is too late yesterday 's decision by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that napster should be prohibited from enabling the swapping of copyrighted music appeared to hand a significant victory to the recording industry in its crusade against internet piracy but the second most asked question among napster users yesterday may indicate that major record labels that sued napster for copyright infringement have a longer way to go to win in the court of public opinion jeffoboy15 's query does anyone know of any other programs for music transfer was echoed and answered by many others the answer is that there are several although none provide the wide range of music or the ease of use of napster much of the debate over napster has centered on whether consumers have a fair use right under copyright law to share music that they already own with whomever they saw fit whether it be one friend or napster 's 58 million users the court ruled yesterday that napster users were infringing copyrights in its decision the court said napster would be required to remove any copyrighted material that it was informed was being being traded through its service and officials at the recording industry association of america the trade group that sued napster on behalf of the major record companies talked of new technologies that would make it possible to identify the copyrighted songs stored on the computers of the individuals who make them available for other napster users to download and listen to but the extraordinary napster phenomenon has been fueled only in part by the technology that made it possible it is also based in the antipathy many users express toward the music industry and the sense that the cost of compact discs is far too high hey napster is stealing songs one participant in the alternative napster chat room wrote yesterday afternoon you must admit if there was no napster you would pay for cd 's another responded no i 'd just burn my friends cd 's the music industry is getting too much cash from kids to burn a cd is to transfer computer files onto a compact disc aware of the sentiments of the napster users some legal scholars who disagreed with parts of the ninth circuit 's decision said the ruling would ultimately work against the recording industry my view is that the riaa loses the battle and loses the war because they become the bad guys said lawrence lessig an expert on internet law at stanford university with every song they tell napster to remove the political resistance to this extreme view of copyright law will grow stronger napster with backing from the bertelsmann music group plans to make a subscription service available in the fall several legal experts said the court decision yesterday would probably encourage a settlement between napster and other major record labels which might enable napster to offer more music by subscription in the meantime however napster users may have to find other alternatives and judging from their online comments few seemed inclined to return to the record store the leading possible substitutes like gnutella and freenet are considerably harder to use but they are also harder to police because unlike napster they do not maintain a central index of users that share music files the developers of those programs said they did not see how the court ruling could be applied to them this is going to make life difficult for a lot of music swapping fans out there said gene kan a developer of gnutella but maybe the larger concern should be that there 's no above ground alternative for napster users in the sense that the music industry has not come forward with their own version of napster to allow people to swap files on line which is something they obviously want to do of the major record labels only bertelsmann has sought to build a fee based music sharing service by teaming with napster many napster users have said they are willing to pay a small fee to use the new service if it works as the current version does to provide access to much of the world 's music but few have expressed an abiding loyalty to napster as it goes mainstream and perhaps unfortunately for the music industry the ability to share digital music files in the mp3 format has acquired a certain subversive cachet that may be hard to shake if napster does shut down there are more sites out there obsidian tempest 24 a security guard and disc jockey in ontario wrote in an e mail message to a reporter and they may get a few but they ca n't stop all of them wes feltz 16 of pittsburgh wrote in an e mail message they 'll never stop mp3 's they 'll always exist i can upload mp3 's on my web site right now if i want to mr feltz for one is not worried about finding a napster alternative he said he had enough cd 's to listen to for now because over the six months that he has been using napster he has burned almost 70 separate discs

as i walked through the local airport last week a baggage handler recognized me and shouted if these two guys ca n't get together and solve this mess neither deserves to be president while his view might not be a realistic solution for the nation the handler was right about the need for the candidates to take control and agree on some sort of process that will bring closure to this election in a very real way the first test of whether al gore or george w bush can be an effective president of the united states is now not the day after the inauguration so far both have allowed their campaign organizations to engage in continuing campaigns to convince the public of the fairness of their positions deploying lawyers spokesmen and campaign managers this way may satisfy the appetite to fight but not the responsibility to reconcile a serious national dilemma no one disputes that this is a unique and challenging moment in our history to have a national election of over 100 million votes come down to a few hundred controversial ballots in florida is without precedent it is understandable that both campaigns having fought long and hard for their candidates want to do whatever it takes to get the very last votes they need to win but while a scorched earth litigation process to the bitter end may make sense to the lawyers and the campaign officials does it make sense for the nation it is obvious that the united states is deeply divided over who should win aggravating those differences in a bitter post election battle will only make it that much more difficult for the winner to govern after the federal court decision not to interfere with florida law both candidates now face a crucial choice they could continue to litigate each election decision that is not acceptable challenging close votes not only throughout florida but in wisconsin iowa new mexico and other states where there are disputed results and continue the battle for votes right up to the electoral college decision in december and perhaps beyond with the supreme court and sheer public exhaustion finally ending the matter or they could come together either in person or through trusted emissaries and agree to a process that would bring this election to closure as fairly and responsibly as possible the choice is theirs since the florida outcome is the deciding factor they could agree for example to allow both sides to hand count those votes that can be challenged under florida law and could establish a deadline perhaps dec 1 for conclusion of that process and complete counting of the absentee ballots the secretary of state for florida could then certify the final results before the electoral college votes both candidates would agree to abide by that final count this kind of agreement between mr gore and mr bush might not satisfy the campaigns or the lawyers or even some of the voters but it would be the right thing for the nation now the candidates are fighting a legal and propaganda war that both are losing more important the nation is losing the presidency is about putting the nation 's interest first having served the president i know the hardest decisions that confront this nation 's leaders are the ones that pit the long term interests of the country against short term political gain deploying troops raising taxes vetoing key legislation or revealing a mistake of judgment may not be very popular but it may be right for the country the legacy of every president rests with how he responds to that choice both of these candidates have campaigned on the basis that they would make the tough choices if and when the time came that time is now leon panetta who was white house chief of staff under president clinton from 1994 to 1997 teaches at california state university at monterey bay

'the decalogue krzysztof kieslowski 's 10 part masterwork was first shown on polish television in 1988 89 and finally released in theaters this year it is a sweeping meditation on the human condition

fresh out of business school takes a white collar management job in the factory where his father has worked as a laborer for 30 years everything at first seems rosy very quickly however he finds himself falling into a treacherous rabbit hole of duplicity and corporate politics that pit father and son against each other in a war between management and labor using a cast of mostly

to the editor as a sept 26 editorial notes democrats are rushing to pass a war resolution that many privately disagree with hoping to avoid having to talk about this issue in the election campaign but the real problem democrats have with voters is that on too many issues they do not act on what everyone knows are their real beliefs it is obvious that many senate democrats think that carrying out the bush tax cuts will produce decades of deficits but none of them will propose eliminating those cuts the effect of condescending to the public on the important questions of the day is that democrats are seen as standing for nothing and give no one a reason to vote for them as long as democrats continue to be paralyzed by political calculation they will neither gain a mandate from voters nor encourage the strong leadership needed to realize their core ideals william s kessler seattle sept 26 2002
to the editor suv 's to be redesigned to reduce risk to cars front page dec 4 gives us a ray of hope toward reducing traffic accidents on the roads but there is one important aspect other than designs that has to be added to these changes that is the attitude of the drivers of suv 's what i suggest is that the manufacturers include in the owners manuals these words remember while you are driving you are just as human as the other drivers remember to be courteous you are not the only one on the road maybe the manufacturers should lower the driver 's seat of the suv 's so that the drivers do n't think they are majestic and high and mighty ernest g d'amato maplewood nj dec 4 2003

running alongside the gurney that is taking her husband to surgery nancy reagan leans over as she clutches a jar of his favorite candy i brought your jelly beans darling she says every action in the simplistic film the day reagan was shot is so clumsily telegraphed that even the jelly beans eventually get their close up as the fictional nancy waits for word from the operating room she sits alone and watches the career shattering news conference in which secretary of state alexander m haig jr announces in a voice so quavering it could only inspire fear i am in control here at the white house she is so appalled she literally spills the beans and the camera focuses on brightly colored candies scattering on the floor around her black pumps that might have been a nice comic touch if the film were a satire but it 's not despite some halfhearted attempts at wit the day reagan was shot is an earnest look at what happened when john w hinckley jr tried to assassinate ronald reagan in march 1981 and if the jelly bean close up seems an odd choice an even stranger decision surrounds the movie why would showtime sandwich this limp re creation between two documentaries about the events the nonfiction programs only highlight the film 's lack of drama and the entire package suggests how difficult it is for a fictional version of recent history to stand beside events that have already been captured by news cameras replayed for years and beaten flat in memoirs recreating history is not the problem here oliver stone an executive producer of this film has built a career on it he was more effective in nixon than in j f k but whatever you think of his interpretations he knows how to use the freedom that fiction offers creating gripping movies and provoking ideas cyrus nowrasteh who wrote and directed the day reagan was shot sticks close to the facts but does n't share mr stone 's creative flair the assassination attempt is recreated in a quick cut style that mimics the jittery news film without capturing its shocking effect but the story 's focus is on the chaotic aftermath and richard dreyfuss deserves his top billing as haig all the president 's men bumble the running of the country secure phone lines do n't work they squabble about whether the level of military readiness has officially been heightened but haig makes a major grab for power and even mistakenly tells the public he is next in line for the presidency after the vice president taking his cue from the heavy handed script mr dreyfuss has a mad dog demeanor from the start much of the film takes place in the white house situation room as other cabinet members and advisers try to calm the rabid haig the rational dignified secretary of defense caspar w weinberger is played by the always superb colm feore thirty two short films about glenn gould with an understated realism that stands out among much scenery chewing next to the pointed dialogue that zooms around the situation room on the west wing these re creations are cartoonish meanwhile the president 's advisers at the hospital including the deputy chief of staff michael k deaver michael murphy effectively manage the news mr reagan was much closer to death than the public knew but today that is not surprising to anyone informed about the events and the story is not presented dramatically enough to grab anyone who is n't richard crenna does n't try to impersonate reagan beyond a tilt of the head all he has to do is be there and mouth a few familiar lines honey i forgot to duck he tells holland taylor who plays nancy straightforwardly as the fiercely devoted wife the day reagan was shot is more interesting for the way it plays next to the documentaries in bulletproof which precedes it mr deaver describes how the president insisted on walking from his car into the hospital when he hit the door frame his knees went out from under him he says it was as if the curtain was there and he had performed when we got to the curtain he gave out the film 's reagan insists on walking too but while he wobbles a bit he never buckles making it all the way to the trauma room on his own in these interpretations the nonfiction reagan is a consummate actor and the fictional reagan just that strong a guy at reagan 's side which follows the movie includes snippets of an audiotape of the situation room conversation made by richard v allen the national security adviser in interviews mr allen and mr weinberger reinforce some portrayals and suggest that their resentment of mr haig 's behavior has persisted through the years but mr allen also says that mr haig was never in charge of anything that day everyone agrees that one person not in charge was the president mr nowrasteh who wrote the pilot for the television series la femme nikita has said i 've really come to respect president reagan and nancy reagan enormously and i hope the movie shows that you have to assume it 's inadvertent then that this muddled film reinforces the image of ronald reagan as the president in the empty suit 'hell in the pacific the learning channel tonight at 9 facts alone are not always enough to carry a documentary but the graphic news film and photographs in this program about world war ii combat in the pacific are amazing on their own presented today to commemorate the bombing of pearl harbor the program includes interviews with allied and japanese soldiers as well as combat film that deserves its advisory stating the images may disturb some viewers the documentary does not clean up the americans ethnic slurs and blunt desire to kill japanese and does not shy away from photographs of japanese atrocities one chinese woman has a chunk missing from the back of her neck where the japanese tried to behead her hell in the pacific is not artistically made but it is enormously valuable as an addition to better known images of nazi atrocities and as a counterpoint to greatest generation

ralph nader was on a tear railing against chief executives salaries the corporate dominated campaign finance system and cuts in factory inspections several of the steelworkers seated around him were nodding and then nodding again in silent approval for a few minutes at least on friday it seemed as if the steelworkers cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated and they were receiving the truth or at least a truth they rarely hear you 're the guys who work hard said mr nader the green party candidate for president you 're the guys who pay the taxes you 're the guys who fight the wars and then they say 'tough we 're closing the factory it 's globalization and then they use factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete against you mr nader whose words though not his speaking style are laced with emotion then laid into vice president al gore and other democrats saying they have done little for labor because they have been able to take labor 's support for granted when you 're taken for granted you 're taken he said when organized labor can say to these candidates 'you 're not going to take us for granted anymore we have an alternative and the alternative is nader and the green party then they 'll start calling afterward the 20 steelworkers who had gathered in a small ohio state university classroom to hear mr nader gave him rave reviews and many of them vowed to vote for him this november mr nader was in columbus for rallies with green party members environmentalists and steelworkers i 'd say nader is the best of anyone said david cole an electrician at ak steel 's mill in mansfield ohio i really like him i have n't seen much from anyone else his friend and co worker larry pugh was just as enthusiastic i think he has the right answers said mr pugh a crane operator at the plant where management locked out 620 workers last september he gives us a choice because the democrats and republicans have sold us down the river this outpouring of enthusiasm for mr nader worries many democrats who fear that so many steelworkers auto workers teamsters and other union members will vote for him this fall that mr gore could lose in ohio and other midwestern swing states for the democrats an added concern is that two of the most powerful unions in the midwest the teamsters and the united auto workers have flirted with mr nader and have not endorsed mr gore even though the afl cio is backing the vice president many steelworkers are still angry at mr gore because he backed the agreement to normalize trade relations with china which many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of american factories to china although mr nader is best known for his crusading on consumer protection and the environment he has grown closer to labor unions in recent years fighting with them against the china trade deal the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement all the steelworkers here hailed mr nader but several said they would still vote for mr gore because they feared gov george w bush would win if mr nader drained too many votes from the vice president i 'd like to thank you for championing our issues skip hall another a steelworker who drove in from mansfield told mr nader you 're terrifying the democrats you know this is going to be a very close election in 1980 i was dissatisfied with jimmy carter i backed ted kennedy and we ended up with ronald reagan he gave us a bad supreme court we 're still living with that today that 's the dilemma we face today the same thing could happen with you the excitement generated by mr nader also concerns some labor leaders john j sweeney the afl cio 's president has repeatedly urged union members to back mr gore saying it is important to prevent mr bush from winning because working with a republican congress he might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety laws george becker president of the united steelworkers of america was one of labor 's most vociferous critics of the china deal but he says it is time to line up behind mr gore he said in an interview that labor 's support for mr nader was modest and would grow smaller and he predicted that many union members leaning toward mr nader would ultimately vote for mr gore upon realizing that mr nader can not win there are two viable candidates al gore and george w bush and we 're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members and the issues of working people mr becker said nader 's a fine man he takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us but he is not a viable candidate in that regard anybody who would support ralph nader we think would lessen al gore 's chances of winning david leland chairman of the ohio democratic party said that the race between mr gore and mr bush was close in his state but that he did not think mr nader would hurt the vice president recent polls show mr nader getting 4 percent of the vote in ohio compared with more than 10 percent in california but mr leland said those were high water marks that were bound to fall most people know a vote for ralph nader is a wasted vote at best and a vote for george bush at worst he said mr becker said he hoped mr gore would become more outspoken on workers issues to excite union members about his candidacy indeed on monday mr gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in cleveland with 75 steelworkers from ohio pennsylvania indiana and illinois the nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union members from drifting toward their candidate mr nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the democratic party left on labor and other issues to make it easier for unions to organize mr nader called for making it legal for a union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but other companies that do business with it such boycotts were banned by the taft hartley act in 1947 he also called for requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire workers for supporting a union asserting that he should be included in any presidential debates mr nader said he would seek to force mr gore and mr bush to address work related issues like occupational safety that have been largely ignored during the campaign gore will tell you 'i 'm for you i 'm going to fight for you i 'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes mr nader said but what has he done in eight years i do n't care what you 're for i want to know what you 've done talk is cheap

how about forcing the iraqi people to take out a mortgage on their newfound freedom using their nation 's future oil revenue as collateral a proposal to do that making a loan out of the 20 billion the bush administration is seeking to cover the first round of reconstruction costs is gaining support in congress of all the bad ideas that have been floated recently about iraq 's future this is one of the worst it is understandable that lawmakers from both parties are suffering sticker shock over president bush 's request for an additional 87 billion for postwar iraq and afghanistan the estimated costs of occupying and rebuilding iraq are skyrocketing while projections for foreign contributions and potential iraqi oil income keep shrinking but adding 20 billion to iraq 's current foreign debt is not the answer iraq already owes tens of billions to france russia and others much of which may have to be written off preferentially guaranteeing iraq 's debt to the united states for funds paid out to american contractors with future oil revenue would only reinforce suspicions around the world about our motives for going to war nor is it sensible economically baghdad may earn only about 10 billion from its oil sales next year and while iraq stands to make more than that in the longer term it is hard to see how the struggling country would be able to repay a 20 billion loan from washington the white house is scrambling to oppose the loan idea but its refusal to level with the american people over the past year about the true costs of the war and its aftermath only fed the notion that no great sacrifices lay ahead its vague talk about oil money 's covering much of the tab did little to prepare congress for the day of reckoning the 20 billion for reconstruction the administration is seeking is a down payment on an investment that could add up to 100 billion in coming years congressional demands for more specifics about how this money will be spent are appropriate but efforts to separate this request from the less controversial 65 billion for military operations are counterproductive lawmakers who overwhelmingly supported this war should face the responsibility for helping to build a stable and functional iraq eventually able to stand on its own right now building new roads and power plants in iraq is as essential to our national interest as paying for the training salaries and equipment of the men and women in the military forces in iraq the alternative moving to make the task just a bit cheaper by saddling the iraqi people with even more foreign debt is a recipe for fomenting resentful anti americanism it sounds more like a punitive versailles style approach to the vanquished instead of the marshall plan for the middle east that the white house keeps promising
in 1942 gordon hirabayashi was imprisoned for violating a military curfew that applied only to japanese americans a preliminary step in the government 's forcible relocation of all persons of japanese ancestry from the west coast to remote detention camps when that began fred korematsu another japanese american evaded detention for which he was also convicted in the mid 1980 's amid a national wave of regret for the wartime discrimination federal courts erased both men 's convictions congress has apologized to japanese americans and reparations have been paid the historical lesson of these two cases appears simple government crackdowns based solely upon race or ethnicity are wrong but while the korematsu and hirabayashi decisions are often cited as infamous examples of the legal vulnerability of ethnic groups their broader lesson is the judiciary 's frailty in the face of pressing concerns about national security that frailty may well resurface as in the wake of the events of sept 11 america debates whether to significantly loosen rules for electronic surveillance and dramatically truncate judicial protections for resident aliens some passages from the supreme court 's two opinions read as if they could apply today the court unanimously affirmed mr hirabayashi 's conviction on the basis that residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry even the court 's more liberal members agreed justice william o douglas said that the wisdom or expediency of the decision which was made is not for us to review justice frank murphy merely registered reluctance few indeed have been the invasions upon essential liberties which have not been accompanied by pleas of urgent necessity advanced in good faith by reasonable men he warned the supreme court likewise affirmed the conviction of mr korematsu but in his case the justices fractured six to three justice hugo black celebrated as a liberal by many scholars declared on behalf of the majority that when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger agreeing with justice black justice felix frankfurter emphasized that action is not to be stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless however one of the three dissenters justice robert h jackson perhaps the best prose stylist ever to sit on the high court argued persuasively that the harm done by the majority would reach far beyond race a military order however unconstitutional is not apt to last longer than the military emergency he wrote but once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the constitution or rather rationalizes the constitution to show that the constitution sanctions such an order the court for all time has validated that rationalizing principle and that principle then lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority than can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need and hirabayashi and korematsu both demonstrated jackson warned that the federal judiciary is unlikely ever to constrain executive branch excess if the people ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous hands the courts wield no power equal to its restraint the chief restraint upon those who command the physical forces of the country in the future as in the past must be their responsibility to the political judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments of history three decades later jackson 's argument was validated by the posthumous confession of the man who as governor of california had been in the words of one sympathetic biographer the most visible and effective force behind the internment the legendary chief justice earl warren celebrated like douglas and black as a liberal chief justice warren professed himself conscience stricken over the role he had played in the 1940 's it was wrong to react so impulsively without positive evidence of disloyalty even though we felt we had a good motive in the security of our state he wrote in his memoirs it demonstrates the cruelty of war when fear get tough military psychology propaganda and racial antagonism combine with one 's responsibility for public security to produce such acts but the decisions are far from universally regretted earl warren 's guilt was not shared by hugo black who even in the late 1960 's embraced his opinion in the korematsu case declaring i would do precisely the same thing today and even in the year 2001 as prominent a judicial voice as richard a posner the circuit court judge confesses that i actually think korematsu was correctly decided chief justice william h rehnquist writing three years ago in his book all the laws but one civil liberties in wartime said that in time of war the government 's authority to restrict civil liberty is greater than in peacetime and that distinctions that might not be permissible between classes of citizens must be viewed otherwise when drawn between classes of aliens indeed chief justice rehnquist volunteered that for cases like korematsu there is no reason to think that future justices of the supreme court will decide questions differently from their predecessors however writing in 1984 in the reopened case that erased mr korematsu 's conviction district judge marilyn hall patel agreed with justice jackson and chief justice warren that the legal legacy of the japanese internment reached beyond racism and illuminated a greater danger it stands as a caution that in times of distress the shield of military necessity and national security must not be used to protect governmental actions from close scrutiny and accountability it stands as a caution that in times of international hostility and antagonisms our institutions legislative executive and judicial must be prepared to exercise their authority to protect all citizens from the petty fears and prejudices that are so easily aroused the rule of fear david j garrow is presidential distinguished professor at emory university

taiwan won formal clearance today to join the world trade organization one day after china received clearance admission of both is expected by the end of this year or early 2002 the terms for admitting taiwan were hammered out almost two years ago but acceptance of a pact was postponed because of a 1992 understanding that beijing would be the first to enter on monday the 142 country members of the trade group gave their approval to china 's membership clearing the way for china to join the open market trading system china which regards taiwan as a breakaway province agreed not to block its joining the condition for chinese taipei as it is officially called by the wto is that entry comes after china 's admission hong kong and macao also part of china have already become members of the trade organization under the separate category of customs territories not countries although taiwan 's entry conditions and commitments were set out in 1200 pages of text longer than the 1000 page document china agreed to it wrapped up its membership in less time than did china beijing pursued membership for 15 years of on and off talks taiwan began negotiating 12 years ago the way is now clear for china and taiwan to receive formal approval for membership at a meeting of trade ministers in doha qatar in november the pacts are subject to the approval of both parliaments if the agreements are ratified there is a 30 day waiting period before the memberships become official although membership requires that members trade with each other on equal terms it does not necessarily mean more trading taiwan currently bars direct trade with china once we become a member of the wto we will be making a decision on our economic and other relations with china said steve chen a negotiator for taiwan we do believe the wto could serve as a very good channel for us to talk to mainland china
following a strategy that was modestly successful last season the mets added another reliever yesterday to a pitching staff that seems to have no available spots the mets acquired rick croushore a right hander from the boston red sox for the class a right hander frank graham and a player to be named croushore 30 was 2 1 with a 771 earned run average in 11 games for colorado and boston last year the red sox had designated him for assignment general manager steve phillips said the mets considered the success croushore had in the 1999 season when he had 88 strikeouts in 71 2 3 innings for the st louis cardinals you look back at his '99 year and he can get a strikeout and he 's got some power to his stuff too phillips said he 's only a year removed from being successful and he 's healthy and he 's got good stuff last year the mets stockpiled left handed pitchers and traded them for utility players jesse orosco was traded to st louis for joe mcewing and bill pulsipher to arizona for lenny harris this year 's bullpen appears set with armando benitez dennis cook john franco donne wall turk wendell and rick white but the additions of croushore and tom martin a former cleveland left hander give the mets flexibility in trades and protection against injuries
players used to chase the dollar now they chase a championship ring this is one trend i hope catches on winning really does matter we talk about athletes and their pursuit of money and the criticism is often true but many athletes have discovered as they grow older that legacy assumes a greater importance in their lives there is no greater legacy in competitive sports than winning that 's why games are played and scores are recorded karl malone and gary payton took pay cuts to join the los angeles lakers with the hope of realizing their dreams of winning an nba championship we always focus on the negative with pro athletes grant hill of the orlando magic said friday night here 's an example of two guys who are about winning this says a lot about their character and priorities this says malone and payton handled their money well enough to pursue a dream in the days before free agency players basically had to stay with the team that first selected them they did n't have the luxury of jumping ship and going with an offer from a championship caliber team hill speaking from his home in orlando fla has watched the various comings and goings of his colleagues as he has come to grips with his own athletic mortality an ankle injury that he sustained while he was with the detroit pistons and that he aggravated in orlando has led to a series of operations that threaten his career a career that had been untouched by misfortune has taken a precarious turn as you get older your priorities change hill said most athletes as they get older have a sense of desperation they know that the end is near they had a great run made a lot of money now it 's about winning that 's why i 'm not surprised by what gary payton and karl malone did they 've always been about winning malone will turn 40 on july 24 he made 192 million last year he agreed to take the veterans minimum salary of 15 million to play for the lakers payton who turns 35 on july 23 earned 126 million last season with the lakers he will earn 49 million in the first year of a multiyear contract by contrast their new teammates shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant will make 265 million and 135 million respectively this season if you ca n't beat 'em join 'em payton and malone are the latest in a line of nba players whose path to a championship has been blocked in their case by one player michael jordan was a granite barrier for malone and for payton as well as for charles barkley and for patrick ewing barkley left the philadelphia 76ers for the phoenix suns in pursuit of a ring in 1993 barkley 's suns lost to jordan 's bulls in the nba finals in 1993 chicago defeated ewing 's knicks in the eastern conference finals in 1994 while jordan was playing baseball the knicks beat the bulls in the conference semifinals and eventually reached the nba finals losing to houston jordan returned late in the 1994 95 season but it was the pacers and not the bulls who beat the knicks in the conference semifinals malone reached the nba finals twice in 1997 and 1998 both times the jazz lost to jordan 's bulls payton was with seattle in 1996 when the sonics lost to chicago in the finals i remember talking with payton at the olympics hill recalled of the 1996 atlanta games they 'd lost to the bulls but they had the same team coming back you could expect them to be in the finals it did n't work out that way a year later seattle failed to go beyond the second round here 's a warning do n't be so quick to crown the lakers as kings you ca n't predict the future hill said i learned that with my ankle anything can happen hill left the pistons in 2000 for orlando he was n't being desperate he was being pragmatic tracy mcgrady was joining the magic that same year after three seasons in toronto the magic was going after tim duncan full force hill would complete the picture duncan remained in san antonio mcgrady blossomed into a star but hill has missed most of three seasons with the ankle injury who could have seen that then that 's the point of course who can anticipate this i was 27 years old at the time hill said i was looking forward to playing with duncan or tracy mcgrady i wanted to be part of helping a franchise get there i felt i had the majority of my career ahead of me now hill now considers himself desperate he comes off crutches wednesday and will put all his weight on the ankle for the first time in a year the quest begins in the last three years i guess you can say i 've developed a sense of urgency hill said i definitely have this same sense of desperation i 'm the oldest player on the roster i was always used to being the youngest now i 'm the oldest i know that when i get back on the court whenever that is this is going to be it you compete to achieve the ultimate and that 's a championship you never know how to figure these things the lakers tried the three star approach in july 1968 when they traded for wilt chamberlain and put him on a team with jerry west who was 30 and elgin baylor who was 34 the three superstars failed to win a championship together then baylor who had been a 10 time all star retired nine games into the 1971 72 season and the lakers went on to win the championship winning as hill knows is capricious in his first two seasons at duke university hill won consecutive national championships he thought that was the way of the world well that was 10 11 years ago he said i want to get back and taste that feeling i want to win everyone does and nearly every player in the history of sports has talked about wanting a championship ring the difference between yesterday and today is that players can afford the luxury of pursuing one
as the nation reflects this week on the meaning of the vietnam war 25 years after the fall of saigon a few fateful words of lyndon johnson 's tumble across the decades to remind us that a senseless conflict might have been avoided on a may morning in 1964 as johnson was weighing whether to expand american military involvement in vietnam he confided in a conversation with senator richard russell that he did not really know why washington should go to war in southeast asia referring to sgt kenneth gaddis who was one of his valets johnson said he was troubled by the idea of sending this father of six children to war and what the hell are we going to get out of his doing it johnson asked himself and it just makes the chills run up my back even so many years later it is hard not to be saddened and angered by johnson 's failure to follow that simple impulse his comments recorded by the white house and published a few years ago by michael beschloss in a compendium of johnson tapes entitled taking charge captured a larger truth that still rests uneasily on the american soul no compelling national interest was served by waging war in vietnam and the men who directed the war including johnson and his secretary of defense robert mcnamara knew it at the time more than 58000 american servicemen lost their lives in a land of negligible political and economic importance to the welfare of the united states the idea that communism would advance inexorably across asia if ho chi minh was victorious in vietnam was the hallucination of men numbed and trapped by the liturgies of the cold war the same men also violated a cardinal principle of politics and warfare by drafting citizens for combat without first building strong public support for their cause the gulf of tonkin resolution approved by congress in 1964 after the pentagon reported that united states naval vessels had been attacked by north vietnam was a flimsy license for committing the country to a land war in asia as opposition grew and demonstrations against the fighting spread across the country johnson and his aides failed to recognize that a divided democracy can not sustain a foreign war without doing grievous damage to itself and its principles by the time johnson realized the harm he had done his political career was wrecked and the domestic achievements of his presidency had been overshadowed by his reckless spilling of american and vietnamese blood the physical wounds of those who fought bravely in vietnam healed long ago but the war will always loom large in their lives as it does in the political memory of the nation it changed america in innumerable ways for better and for worse it undermined a generation 's faith in the judgment and truthfulness of its military and diplomatic leaders but above all it taught us that the united states must not commit its soldiers to protracted combat in the absence of clear security interests and that future wars can not be fought without the support of the american people for these and many other reasons the vietnam war memorial in washington is different from the other monuments where america honors its fallen soldiers the starkness and simplicity of the memorial with the names of each soldier etched in polished black granite reminds visitors that no victory is celebrated on this spot no noble cause honored in memory of those who sacrificed their lives the monument instead commemorates the needless sacrifice of troops who were betrayed by a president who prosecuted a war he did not believe in for a goal that he could not define in public speeches or private conversation that more than anything is what the nation must remember this week and that is why the words of lyndon johnson still sting
when manager joe torre reached the mound in the bottom of the seventh inning tonight he clapped his hands before taking the ball from jose contreras it seemed to be an empty gesture because there was little for contreras to celebrate after a month away from the yankees he had failed miserably in his return contreras 's december signing touched off a feud between the yankees principal owner george steinbrenner and the red sox president larry lucchino who both bid for contreras after he defected from cuba when contreras struggled early and was sent to tampa instead of class aaa columbus torre quarreled with steinbrenner the question now is what was all the fuss about contreras got out of a jam tonight but created another and the yankees have still gotten nothing from their four year 32 million investment in him contreras threw fastballs reaching 95 miles an hour but he allowed five runs and got only four outs blowing the lead in the seventh inning of a 10 7 loss to the boston red sox pedro martinez missed his start because of a strained muscle below his right shoulder blade but the red sox won anyway feasting on contreras and jeff weaver after the game torre was still stressing the positive praising contreras for throwing confidently after seeming so tentative in april it is a worthwhile strategy for a sensitive pitcher like contreras who admitted before the game that he put too much pressure on himself early on partly because of his contract i was very pleased torre said i thought this was more of a plus than a minus in the long run i thought his command was much better than when he left i thought his stuff was better and he seemed to be more confident in letting the ball go the yankees believe contreras can be a premier starter a notion shared by the red sox who offered him a four year 27 million deal but there is no place in the rotation unless the struggling weaver is bumped weaver has allowed 72 hits in 57 2 3 innings and opponents are batting 308 against him he gave up five runs on seven hits and four walks and did not record an out in the sixth it 's been back and forth pretty much the whole start of the season weaver said way too many walks i 'm not a guy who picks corners i go right after guys mechanically i feel good at times and for some reason i might lose it weaver will have time to smooth his mechanics torre said it would be unfair to consider pulling him from the rotation even with contreras back no not now torre said jeff weaver is an established starter of course contreras is also but i think we 'd like to go a little bit longer and see what happens we 're all pitching for a spot all the starters we have to compete every day it 's nothing new i do n't think we 're trying to apply that kind of pressure there 's enough pressure in this game without threatening people the game had started with such promise for the yankees martinez 's replacement bruce chen gave up a homer to alfonso soriano on the first pitch of the game the yankees scored again in the inning and held a 3 1 lead after two but boston steadily hammered weaver who kept leaving pitches up in the strike zone the red sox had five extra base hits off him the last a two run homer by jason varitek that gave them a 4 3 lead after four the former yankee ramiro mendoza relieved chen and gave up four consecutive singles allowing the yankees to go ahead when weaver left in the sixth the yankees had a 6 5 lead with two runners on and no one out contreras got a double play grounder and a strikeout ending the inning torre believed he had found a solution to the yankees setup relief problems i had visions of him taking us right to mo torre said referring to closer mariano rivera i was very confident with him going out there for the next inning contreras who said his mechanics were a total disaster in april started the seventh working from the stretch which had felt comfortable in the sixth but he walked the leadoff man todd walker i tried to overprotect that one run lead contreras said through an interpreter i should have just gone right after him and attacked him contreras jammed the next hitter nomar garciaparra with a splitter but garciaparra blooped a double to left off the end of his bat and an intentional walk to manny ramirez loaded the bases contreras tried to throw david ortiz a fastball off the plate but he missed his spot and ortiz bashed a two run double to the warning track in deep left center the red sox led 7 6 and continued to pile on i faced contreras once in spring training and all he was throwing was off speed pitches ortiz said i saw him tonight throwing a lot of fastballs i guess they 've been working on that i guess somebody told him that the big league club is different from whatever he played before he 's got a good fastball he 's got to use it that was contreras 's plan and catcher jorge posada was pleased to see him execute it i thought he was more aggressive posada said his stuff was better and he came after hitters it 's just a matter of time to put it all together that time was not tonight contreras has a 1563 earned run average and no answers for his struggles he pitched well in the minors tightened his mechanics restored his confidence he is still waiting for results

kmart which began presenting its reorganization strategy before a federal judge in chicago yesterday said that the majority of its creditors had approved its plan to emerge from bankruptcy but the company which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in january 2002 could face fierce opposition from a small group of creditors before the hearing began yesterday those creditors filed about 175 objections to the company 's plan and how they would be reimbursed kmart said it considered this opposition to be immaterial but the retailer will still have to contend with disenchanted firms like capital factors inc a creditor whose lawyers filed an emergency motion to delay the hearing yesterday the proceedings which are taking place in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois are expected to last at least two days but the hearing could easily stretch into tomorrow people close to the case said if kmart 's plan is approved by the court the company could come out of chapter 11 in as little as 10 days kmart has said that it plans to leave bankruptcy protection by april 30 and return to profitability by 2004 under its reorganization plan kmart will receive about 300 million from two investors edward s lampert and martin j whitman who are known for putting money into companies they consider undervalued the men will also control four of the nine seats on the company 's board kmart is already trying to reposition itself in the marketplace the company is closing a total of 599 stores and trimming its work force by 57000 it will still have 1500 stores when it emerges from bankruptcy kmart is also trying to attract customers by offering a variety of incentives kmart filed for bankruptcy after a series of missteps including the initiation of a price war with wal mart concerns reached an apex in late january 2002 when some kmart suppliers feared that the company would not be able to pay for goods it had ordered and stopped shipping products to the retailer but kmart 's troubles date back much further in the last two decades kmart has struggled to maintain its customer base the chain has lost ground because of increased competition from wal mart which has a grip on cost conscious suburbanites and from target which appeals to hip trendy shoppers who are more fashion conscious shortly after kmart filed for bankruptcy charges of accounting irregularities surfaced at the company the economy worsened and martha stewart the personality behind one of kmart 's best selling product lines came under scrutiny by the securities and exchange commission for her stock trades some analysts said that kmart perhaps because of pressure from its lenders was seeking to come out of bankruptcy protection too quickly they have n't articulated a strategy said walter k levy the managing director for retail trends and positioning at kurt salmon associates all they 've done is have a series of tactics they still have n't defined why the customer should shop there rather than wal mart or target that really is the bottom line the company has also been criticized for hiring inexperienced chief merchandising and chief store operations officers that 's one of the reasons their same store sales continue to trend downward said burt flickinger iii a managing partner of the strategic resource group target and wal mart have at least stabilized during this recession as kmart works to shed its chapter 11 status soon it faces a tough marketplace in which retailers have recorded disappointing sales and consumers concerned about the war and the weak economy have been spending less given the challenges ahead some analysts suggested a worst case situation in which kmart could stumble badly and wind up back in bankruptcy in a few years companies that have slipped back into bankruptcy include montgomery ward which declared bankruptcy in 1997 and again in 2000 and bradlees which came out of bankruptcy protection in 1999 and re entered in 2000 both companies ultimately went out of business
prominent national democrats now regard senator robert g torricelli of new jersey as their party 's most vulnerable senate incumbent prompting concern that his endangered seat might cost democrats control of the senate many democrats said they had expected mr torricelli to overcome his ethics troubles more easily instead his predicament has roiled the party and stirred resentment toward him among fellow democrats some of them say that mr torricelli 's wounds are self inflicted and that he opened himself to attack not to mention gave ammunition to his republican challenger douglas r forrester by engaging in behavior that led the senate ethics committee to reprimand him in july for improperly accepting gifts from a campaign donor echoing a sentiment that is widespread among party leaders in and out of congress terry mcauliffe the chairman of the democratic national committee said he now viewed mr torricelli as the most endangered democratic incumbent in the senate torricelli 's is the tightest mr mcauliffe said in an interview this week referring to mr torricelli 's race he 's dead even at best some democrats also say they are concerned that the party 's focus on new jersey threatens to limit the money and other resources that are available for other democrats in september alone the democratic senatorial campaign committee spent 21 million on three television advertisements promoting mr torricelli 's positions on crucial voting issues in new jersey including abortion rights environmental protection and gun safety democratic party officials say they intend to pump well over 5 million into helping mr torricelli defend his seat but mr mcauliffe and other party leaders also say that the interest generated by the torricelli race has helped draw more money than they expected bob is bringing millions of dollars in mr mcauliffe said if anything bob is creating excitement out there and helping raise more money the situation is a remarkable reversal of fortune for mr torricelli who is completing his first term in the senate after serving in the house as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee in 2000 he helped bring the number of democrats in the senate to 50 the party gained its one vote advantage last year when senator james m jeffords of vermont left the republican party to become an independent but now some of the same senators mr torricelli helped are concerned that his troubles may send democrats back into the minority it 's come as a surprise to many of us that this race is as close as it is said senator charles e schumer democrat of new york this is now one of the two or three most important races for us as democrats because control of the senate could hinge on its outcome james carville the democratic consultant said the ethics committee report turned a noncompetitive race into a competitive race mr torricelli 's campaign manager ken snyder acknowledged that the senator faced a difficult challenge in june mr torricelli led mr forrester by 14 points now several independent political publications including the cook political report and the rothenberg report are rating the race as a tossup or leaning toward mr forrester the president of a company that manages pharmacy benefits but mr snyder said mr torricelli would prevail because of his rival 's opposition to abortion rights and gun control which he said would not go over well with new jersey voters mr snyder also criticized mr forrester 's stand on the environment in deference to mr torricelli many senators declined to criticize their colleague publicly a top senate democrat said the level of concern among mr torricelli 's colleagues was so deep that senate leaders had pulled mr torricelli aside to ask how he could have inflicted such damage on his own political prospects but mr torricelli did not provide a full explanation apart from acknowledging errors in judgment this democrat recalled mr torricelli 's supporters acknowledge that he brought his problems on himself but they add it is important for democrats not to lose sight of what is at stake in the november election continued democratic control of the senate senator joseph i lieberman democrat of connecticut agreed that the turn in mr torricelli 's position was surprising there are a significant number of races that are very competitive and could go either way mr lieberman said and so what you have to say now is that the new jersey race is one more race that becomes from what we read in the polls competitive but it 's one of many i mean this election is going to be extremely close the senate could go either way one person close to mr torricelli sought to wring some good out of the senator 's troubles saying that at least now the national party had his race on the election map it 's entirely possible that new jersey would have been overlooked and the resources would have come too late this person said fortunately the party became mobilized before labor day and will make the necessary effort to help torricelli win mr torricelli 's troubles involve an accusation that he improperly accepted thousands of dollars in unreported gifts and cash from a political supporter david chang mr torricelli did not deny taking gifts from mr chang but said he took no illegal gifts the justice department referred the case to the senate ethics committee after prosecutors closed their inquiry without indicting mr torricelli in july the ethics committee severely admonished him asserting that he had violated senate rules some democrats say the action taken by the ethics committee was so mild that they did not expect it to hurt mr torricelli 's re election campaign but republicans have seized on it and mr forrester has even called on mr torricelli to resign the senate ethics committee thought what they did was appropriate but no big deal said one prominent senate democrat and then to see it blow up like this there are so many other things that would have been more severe if the evidence had warranted it a letter of reprimand is really on the scale of what an ethics committee can do relatively minor

with members of the best team in school history in attendance the city college men 's basketball team finished the most improbable run in city university of new york athletic conference history defeating staten island 77 69 last night at the nat holman gymnasium on the city college campus becoming the first no 8 seeded team to win the conference tournament the beavers 14 14 captured their first conference title since 1980 and advanced to the division iii ncaa tournament in any sport you want to gel right before you enter the playoffs said ccny coach andy stampfel whose beavers had lost six in a row before winning four straight this week we came together at the right time staten island 18 9 took a 15 7 lead on a layup by david paul the conference player of the year midway through the first half but ccny responded with a 10 2 run and led at the half 29 28 on obinna efobi 's 3 point play the beavers never trailed in the second half building a 9 point lead a layup by paul cut the lead to 6 with eight minutes left but consecutive 3 pointers by jason knock and aki trent boosted the lead back to 12 and the beavers hung on efobi a freshman was the game 's leading scorer with 19 points while the senior ralph perez contributed 15 and was named the tournament 's most valuable player i kept telling our players that we were n't really an eight seed and asked them to believe stampfel said i 'm so happy for them at halftime the conference honored the surviving members of ccny 's 1949 50 nit and ncaa championship teams floyd layne ed warner and leroy watkins attended in the women 's final the senior courtney aimetti had 21 points and 23 rebounds as the staten island dolphins topped hunter college to win their second consecutive cuny athletic conference title 83 70 winning last year was great but this one is much better said aimetti who was named the tournament 's most valuable player we have a very young team and i thought that that might hinder us despite dominating the glass and dictating the tempo in the first half the dolphins 20 8 led by only 4 points at halftime and that lead was quickly erased by the top seeded hawks 18 9 who took their first lead on a jumper by bridget evers five minutes into the second half but the dolphins stormed back behind aimetti and forward keisha cook who scored all 19 of her points in the second half this was the fourth straight year that staten island and hunter have met in the tournament final the hawks won in 1998 and 1999 while the dolphins have won the past two
the united nations oil for food program in iraq has little prospect of releasing even 1 billion of its approximately 14 billion for emergency food and medical aid before its authorization runs out on may 12 the program 's director said in an interview today and while benon sevan director of the office of iraq program hopes to persuade the security council to extend the program 's emergency authorization until june 3 he said its complexities and the political debates whirling around it made it unlikely that its outlays would reach 10 percent of the funds available even with the time extension the program 's future has been in limbo since last week when president bush called for an end to united nations sanctions against iraq because the oil for food program was created to ease the burden of sanctions on ordinary iraqis ending the sanctions effectively means ending the program that controls most of the iraqi economy the iraqi government did the contracting for the program offering billions of dollars worth of business to companies from countries with which it wanted to trade in the seven years since the program began one security council diplomat said today russian companies did twice as much business as any other country 's firms 73 billion in oil purchases and the sale of other goods since 1996 other leading trading partners were egypt at 43 billion and france at 37 billion jordan the united arab emirates and china each did more than 3 billion in business through the program the diplomat said the idea of cutting off the russian and french contracts has wide appeal in republican circles in washington where those countries opposition to the war is remembered bitterly but little has been said about the implications of doing the same to egypt and jordan two of the countries the united states has worked most closely with in the middle east in an interview today mr sevan turned away all questions about specific countries and specific contracts i do n't look at contracts in terms of countries of origin he said i look at the contracts in terms of what is required he added if we start going to a determination if something is good or bad by country of origin we are playing politics and i do n't want to be part of it part of the delay in expediting emergency food and medical supplies to iraq mr sevan said stemmed from 10 days of procedural haggling among security council representatives on the program 's oversight committee more time was taken determining what aid was already on its way and what would be needed as i said yesterday mr sevan said my hands are tied and my legs are tied and i 'm being asked to serve a seven course dinner that 's the problem to unravel the web of contracts approved by a security council committee that included representatives from the united states and the united kingdom could take months mr sevan indicated currently the escrow account for the program contains 103 billion earmarked for goods like health related equipment 437 million electrical equipment 13 billion water and sanitation equipment 513 million and spare parts for oil production 2 billion an additional 6 billion of contracts have been approved but until the oil starts flowing again no revenue will come in to pay for them and it is unclear who will be in charge of the oil sales when they resume even the 85 million barrels of iraqi oil at the turkish port of ceyhan can not be sold mr sevan said because there is no legally sanctioned owner to sell it mr sevan is to discuss these issues at a closed security council session on tuesday afternoon he will appear a few hours after hans blix a chief weapons inspector talks to the council about his group 's readiness to return to iraq the debate over what role the united nations will play in the new iraq has brought the oil for food program into prominence it has also revived longstanding criticisms over items like its administrative budget paid for from a 22 percent share of all the oil sold under the program which has totaled more than 1 billion under united nations supervision designed to keep iraq from importing the raw materials for unconventional weapons iraq 's former government sold up to 22 million barrels of oil daily and purchased goods ranging from electrical generators to spare parts for oil field equipment to the basic food rations for 60 percent of the iraqi populace

to the editor your article bemoaning the intractability of the electorate the melting pot politics of 2000 are truly soupy week in review feb 13 points up a major shortcoming with current political punditry one that is evident in the published results of most exit polls the problem arises when analysts examine voter identification variables race gender religion and income among many others individually or in tiny clusters the only way really to get at the electorate is to perform multivariate analysis one in which all the relevant variables are examined simultaneously the raw survey data permit the use of statistical methods to explain and predict how individuals vote and yet pundits still seem to prefer to grasp at straws instead why lex renda glendale wis feb 13 2000 the writer is an associate professor of history at the university of wisconsin milwaukee

one oddity of election night 2000 some would call it a relief was that the four men who battered our eardrums in their quests for the presidency and vice presidency fell abruptly silent not a creature was stirring or accepting or conceding not even joe lieberman oops even this is not quite true a few connecticut ears did hear mr lieberman 's voice around 9 20 pm broadcast on speakers at the goodwin hotel in hartford where democrats had gathered to await the returns mr lieberman 's senior senate colleague united states senator christopher dodd ascended the podium and on the strength of the false florida projection incited not exactly a victory celebration but at least a sack dance then mr dodd announced a special treat over the speakers came mr lieberman 's voice advising as had mr dodd that nothing was settled but agreeing that things were looking awfully good thanking all concerned etc did n't do it alone etc so much love etc he were calling from what is known as a hold which is where they keep you if you 're so important that you have to be ushered out on stage at a certain time and too important to be seen loitering casually in the vicinity beforehand the hold is an apt metaphor for that very trying night in mr lieberman 's life for the days that followed it for the next four years of his career and for the fortunes of other connecticut figures whose futures hinged in great measure on the activities of clerks in obscure florida counties in year 2000 connecticut politics limbo has been the look of the season with the presidential election mess not quite resolved at the time of this writing there are more questions than there are answers but certain issues are inescapable mr lieberman 's national standing by most reckonings if the gore ticket loses mr lieberman is an automatic front runner in the 2004 democratic presidential hunt after all mr gore was at least 14 points down when he tapped mr lieberman and pulled up to parity and even the most merciless who lost florida analysis would have to concede that sans mr lieberman it would have easily been george w bush 's state on the other hand mr lieberman 's political style his cultural conservatism his chummy debate performance with opposite number dick cheney his fondness for public displays of religiosity may have worked better for a democratic second banana than it will for a top dog and the national press shows signs that its romance with mr lieberman is fading a little by the end of sunday oct 29 after making the rounds of the morning talk shows mr lieberman had taken some tough questions revealing that he might have voted to confirm robert bork as supreme court justice if he 'd been in the senate at the time and that although he supports abortion choice he would oppose it for his wife or daughters if gore loses says one party insider there 's going to be a lot of soul searching about what the party should be in 2004 mr lieberman 's mix of conservatism and piety may not be palatable to the larger democratic party he 'd have to change again says the democratic source mr lieberman in the state his performance during the summer and fall suggested that mr lieberman 's role in connecticut politics as vice president would closely parallel prince charles 's role in great britain largely symbolic and clouded with mixed feelings while running with mr gore mr lieberman evinced cheerful but limited interest in connecticut affairs including his own senate campaign he raised at least 25 million more than he needed to defeat the surmountable waterbury mayor phil giordano and if he had any thoughts of using the overage to help embattled state candidates these seem not to have been translated into action there has been low level grumbling among party insiders about this but then the party picked up seats in the state house and senate and had in general a very sunny election day save for the demise of united states representative sam gejdenson the phrase lieberman coattails is now spoken much more loudly than where was he in state polls indicate that the voters regard mr lieberman as a beloved if slightly prodigal son they disapproved of his dual candidacy but emphatically forgave him for it mr lieberman and mr dodd connecticut 's two senators maintain a cheery show of support and affability but a certain edginess underlies it mr dodd the senior senator has played the good sport but he has no stomach for living in mr lieberman 's shadow there are some early signs that the two men will begin carving out different roles with mr dodd taking the more active role in shaping the democratic political future in connecticut and mr lieberman seeking the washington limelight when mr dodd ascended the stage at the goodwin tuesday night he made a point of introducing two people who had worked behind the scenes the first was john olson head of the state afl cio the second was edward marcus the state party chairman mr olson had been moving around the state for months lining up votes for a challenge to mr marcus mr dodd who has opposed mr marcus in the past appeared to be making a point by introducing his rival first mr marcus in his remarks to the crowd noted that mr lieberman was going to be elected to the senate that night by the biggest margin in connecticut history eclipsing the record of chris dodd it was a needle pinking mr dodd in the raw wound of his new status as the second biggest gorilla in the connecticut senate delegation the next four years of connecticut democratic party life will play out like installments of i claudius who will win the olson marcus battle if there is one when it comes time to redistrict next year and the state loses a congressional seat will the democratic majority in the general assembly avenge mr gejdenson by eliminating the second district how will the ambitions of attorney general richard blumenthal united states representative rosa delauro the former gubernatorial candidate william curry bridgeport mayor joseph ganim secretary of state susan bysiewicz comptroller nancy wyman senate majory leader george jepsen and perhaps even the attorney ted kennedy jr be squeezed through that funnel where the prize seekers at the beginning far exceed prizes at the end in the spirit of i claudius and for that matter life in the hold many of these questions are interlinked ms bysiewicz might like to run for mr gejdenson 's old seat in 2002 but ca n't if it 's gone mr ganim has gubernatorial aspirations but would be hurt if his ally mr marcus is deposed mr blumenthal is the presumptive nominee for the next open senate seat but mr lieberman seems intrigued by ms delauro especially because her husband pollster stanley greenberg is a gore lieberman consiglieri a lot of this energy is dammed up behind the logjam of mr lieberman 's complex situation and one thing we know about logjams is that when they break the water and wood start moving very fast election memo colin mcenroe is a radio talk

to the editor re for democrats economy 's surge poses challenge front page nov 2 perhaps the real challenge to democrats over the economic surge is to find courage to tell it as it is to explain believable ideas for solutions comprehensibly and to convince people who should be voting americans need to hear that surges affecting some measurements of the economy will not bring economic stability especially to the middle class so long as corporations are dropping workers in america and contracting the work abroad we must expect this to continue so long as corporations gain great tax benefits as well as old fashioned profits perhaps the most formidable of the challenges will be to citizens who do n't believe that their vote matters or who suppose it makes no difference who wins the elections that is those who no longer believe that america is a democracy jan guardiano fort myers fla nov 2 2003

marion berry a democratic representative from arkansas has raised congressional arrogance to a new level gripped by ideological fury in june mr berry added a provision to the agricultural spending bill stripping funds from the office of james lyons an under secretary of agriculture who oversees the forest service and the natural resources conservation service mr lyons 's republican critics later modified the amendment so that it left the funding intact but stripped him of his authority to run the agencies either way it was clear that mr lyons had been singled out for special abuse and that mr berry had started the crusade what had mr lyons done to deserve this according to mr berry himself the under secretary 's main sin was to side with the environmental protection agency when it decided to enforce a long dormant provision of the clean water act to get a better grip on polluted runoff from so called non point sources like farms city streets and golf courses mr lyons helped the epa establish a timetable that would enable farmers to comply with the law on a reasonable schedule but he never challenged the agency 's authority to enforce the law as some agricultural lobbyists had hoped he would nor was he in mr berry 's view sufficiently pro farmer in his negotiations a conservationist mr lyons has angered members of congress before not least for his support of president clinton 's plan to put millions of acres of the national forests off limits to new roads as well as his efforts to enlarge protections for alaska 's tongass national forest but nobody had gone so far as to undermine his job the white house already worn out from its efforts to block anti environmental riders in other bills is unlikely to fight this one in part because it will have no serious effect on the two agencies or even on mr lyons himself the provision expires jan 20 when mr lyons will leave washington to teach at yale but it is still a petty gesture that brings no honor on mr berry or the other congressmen who have willingly gone along with his vendetta
public diplomacy the current and gentler term for international propaganda has lately been the subject of task force reports and articles in foreign policy and foreign affairs and both houses of congress will be considering relevant legislation early in their next session one of the first applications of the new thinking on public diplomacy is state department mini documentaries about the lives of muslim americans currently broadcast as commercials on indonesian television the state department is trying to emphasize american values and their wide applicability as well as the accomplishments of americans i have been doing international broadcasting audience research for 25 years and i am not aware of any persons huddled by their radios to hear about the achievements and values of the united states or any other country people do listen to foreign broadcasts if they are in countries where information is controlled by the government they listen to the stations that best provide a credible substitute for the news they are not getting from their domestic media during most of the postwar years radio moscow was the behemoth of international radio yet its audience was normally a small fraction of that of the major western stations this is because radio moscow transmitted propaganda britain spent much less than the soviet union on international broadcasting and still spends less than the united states but its bbc world service has the largest audience and most prestige of any international radio station this is largely because the bbc world service has with rare exceptions remained independent of british government control the american radio stations voice of america radio free europe radio liberty and radio free asia have generally adhered to their news missions and have earned good reputations among their audiences there is nonetheless a persistent ambiguity to american international broadcasting the bbc is prohibited from broadcasting editorials voa by contrast is officially required to broadcast united states government editorials almost all of the recent reports articles bills and speeches about public diplomacy put international broadcasting in the same basket as public diplomacy public diplomacy however manages information to put the united states and its policies in the best light in my experience this is exactly the type of pro government reporting that audiences seek to escape by tuning to foreign broadcasts american decision makers may wonder why on earth they should provide money to a radio or television station that merely tells the truth for the answer let us consider the arab target audience arabs are largely opposed to american policies toward israel and palestine and to any possible american invasion of iraq no amount of spin will make a dent in the public opinion of the arab world however arabs will listen to a radio station or watch a television channel that provides news that is more comprehensive and reliable than what they get from their domestic media well informed they can make up their own minds about current events they will be grateful to the united states for providing such a service the independent journalism of such an american station would be an example of how democracy works arab audiences will hear debate in congress among pundits and in assembly halls sometimes it will be raucous but that 's part of its attraction they may wish for such open differences of opinion in their own countries sooner or later they will hear a viewpoint perhaps from a member of congress perhaps from an american newspaper editorial that is not so far from their own they will understand that such an opinion may not be the bush administration 's foreign policy but it is american and something that will help them relate to america then audiences in the arab world and elsewhere may understand america a bit more and dislike it a bit less all told it might be enough to make a difference kim andrew elliott is an analyst in the office of research of the united states international broadcasting bureau which includes the voice of america

accountants are trained to make complicated corporate situations neat and easily comprehensible and that is just what representatives of arthur andersen tried to do at yesterday 's congressional hearings into the destruction of enron documents a panel of employees of the accounting giant testified that the fault for what now appears to be a truly huge document shredding project spread out over months and perhaps involving scores of workers lay entirely with a single man david duncan who has been fired as an andersen auditor dorsey baskin managing director of andersen 's professional standards group declared gravely that mr duncan the engagement partner responsible for the enron account had acted without any consultation with others in the firm or so far as we are aware with legal counsel c e andrews an andersen global managing partner also funneled the blame to mr duncan that is not andersen he said of the document destruction that is not what we encourage our employees to do nancy temple who was in charge of enron litigation for andersen appeared crestfallen that mr duncan had embarked on his document shredding spree without her knowledge i only wish she sighed that someone would have raised the question the only andersen employee who did not pick up the theme was not surprisingly mr duncan himself whose version of events remains unknown since he pleaded the fifth amendment to all the committee 's questions while the andersen team was testifying in the house a senate committee heard arthur levitt the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission repeat his calls for tougher conflict of interest rules for the accounting industry and take a swipe at reform proposals put forth by his successor harvey pitt it was the start of what promises to be a long season of enron hearings it would certainly make life easier for arthur andersen if the world accepted its story the accounting industry version of the lone gunman theory but yesterday no one on the house energy and commerce subcommittee appeared convinced as the lawyer on whose watch the document destruction occurred ms temple had the most explaining to do she was the one who sent an e mail to a top andersen executive in houston on oct 12 telling him to remind the enron team of the firm 's document retention and disposal policy was that a reminder to protect necessary papers or did it amount one congressional inquisitor asked pointedly to a shredding order just as troublesome was the timeline of events as presented by the andersen team ms temple eventually got around to telling mr duncan that all the enron documents had to be preserved but not until nov 9 more than two weeks after the sec began its inquiry into enron why the committee wanted to know did ms temple wait so long andersen insists that it was solely mr duncan 's decision whether or not to destroy documents up until november even though at that point the sec 's investigation of enron was well under way and andersen had retained a large new york law firm to help it defend against possible lawsuits with all those red flags flapping around would andersen still leave the decision about which documents to save and which to destroy entirely to mr duncan an accountant without any input from the firm 's lawyers the committee chairman billy tauzin for one was skeptical enough to warn any accounting firms that might be watching the hearings not to try to make this argument in the future another republican cliff stearns risked stating the obvious when he asked is mr duncan being made a scapegoat here this morning the ancient greeks believed that by beating a human outcast with rods and shouting out with hunger and in with health and wealth they could drive their troubles away if arthur andersen is trying to update the ritual it has gotten off to a bad start
when mike piazza talked with steve phillips shortly after the mets season ended the conversation probably sounded like one between a child and a department store santa claus piazza was the best hitter in a woeful mets lineup last season and he wants help phillips the mets general manager who will probably not increase a bulging payroll might not deliver the players on piazza 's wish list i 'd like to shoot for the stars and settle for the moon piazza said yesterday you ask me i 'll list an all star team so maybe i 'm not the best guy piazza was among several mets who participated in robin ventura 's charity bowling event at chelsea piers yesterday one of them the reserve outfielder joe mcewing re signed with the mets for one year and 750000 yesterday the team has been quiet otherwise but piazza is hoping for action you definitely know your place as a player piazza said but he went on to list the free agents moises alou barry bonds jason giambi and juan gonzalez as players he hoped would join the mets the team has serious questions about fitting any of those players into its payroll without projecting what the possibilities are edgardo plus another factor could mean a great lineup piazza said we 'll just wait and see edgardo alfonzo took part in the bowling fundraiser and said he no longer wakes up with the lower back pain that contributed to his dreadful season alfonzo is working out four times a week with a personal trainer in connecticut pushing himself harder than he did in previous winters when he went home to venezuela it 's kind of tough to play with pain and now 's the time to realize that work hard and get my body in shape for next year alfonzo said

my mother was recently pulled over by a police officer for making an illegal turn he asked to see her driver 's license and then leaned his head in her car window listen jean the officer said to her ca n't you read signs my mother who is of a certain age and generally has the utmost respect for the law responded severely young man she said you do n't know me well enough to call me by my first name well at least i know where i got it from the first time i met with unwelcome familiarity was when my daughter was a small child and had a 6 year old playmate in the backyard caroline an adorable little redhead suddenly called to me from the backyard hey she shouted hey you after i determined that the child was speaking to me i gently admonished her caroline i said please call me by my name i am mrs lombardi a few minutes later she tried again hey hey kate i have always felt like a bit of a curmudgeon on this subject and certainly out of step with the times the majority of my friends prefer to be called by their first names by children who are not their own they say to be referred to as mrs or even ms makes them feel old or even gasp like their mothers one friend said she always looks over her shoulder to check for her mother in law when someone calls her mrs cohen well call me old fashioned but it warms my heart when someone steps out of my car and says thanks very much for the ride mrs lombardi i feel a rush of affection for the child who calls the house and says hello mrs lombardi this is evan may i speak to paul please conversely i get profoundly irritated when the voice on the phone grunts hey paul there i will not even get started on children who walk into my house and open the refrigerator and start browsing its contents or who pick up my telephone and dial whomever they please when i was a child i was given a book called white gloves and party manners this proved to be a treasure trove of useful information ranging from telephone to table manners there was even a special chapter on complicated foods which offered specific instructions on tackling artichokes and lobster another chapter was devoted to meetings greetings and goodbyes my favorite was the last line in that chapter which read and should you ever meet a king or queen you say 'how do you do your majesty though this occasion has yet to arise many of the other etiquette lessons that my parents hammered into me repeatedly have come up daily thank you please napkin in your lap elbows off the table look someone in the eye when you shake her hand i would n't have dreamed of calling any of my parents friends by their first names very close friends were called aunt and uncle the rest remain mr and mrs or dr to this day in turn i hound my own children with these lessons but this being westchester that which you are not willing to do yourself can be purchased in a county where you can hire someone to teach your child to ride a bike so too can you enroll them in manners school instead of sitting at the dinner table with your own offspring reminding them not to interrupt their father to sit up straight and to stop that disgusting slurping you can sign them up for manners for children the etiquette advantage taught by nancy williams and betty hoover that 's mrs williams and mrs hoover to you this new rochelle based course goes over the same material that most parents once did they 've taught their class which covers everything from correct handshakes and introductions to dining room etiquette do not chew gum at the table do not put it on your salad plate excuse yourself to remove the gum are a few tips at all manner of public private and religious schools private groups and birthdays can be arranged and brownie scouts can take the class for their manners merit badge this year i 'm thinking of sending a gift certificate of tuition to a certain child i know who opened a carefully selected gift from me on christmas and upon holding the blouse up said my god i would never wear anything this color i would n't expect a thank you note

to the editor re labor standards clash with global reality front page april 24 i would be willing to pay more for a shirt if i knew that it was made by workers earning a decent wage not child laborers or virtual slaves yet i often have to settle for sweatshop made shirts because there is n't much of a choice right now consumers routinely pay more for products not tested on animals or made from recycled paper i am confident that a sweatshop free label would sell very well regardless of the added cost mikael elsila brooklyn april 24 2001
the success of shows like survivor has many wondering where reality television is headed this question has recently come up with our own program confessions which takes an unfiltered look at convicted murderers and other violent felons reality television actually comes in two forms the first which might be called manufactured reality includes shows like survivor and big brother in which real people as opposed to actors are taped in contrived environments often with hollywood production techniques the second unmanufactured reality allows the camera to record real events and presents them with little editing examples include widely applauded programming like katie couric 's colonoscopy on today as well as controversial programming like dr jack kevorkian 's lethal injection of a patient on 60 minutes court tv whose purpose is to cover the full spectrum of crime and justice issues has been in the business of unmanufactured television since 1991 when it first began providing live courtroom coverage recently however we have been criticized for our new series that plays the taped confessions of convicted murderers and other violent felons the issue is whether this format contributes to the public 's understanding of its criminal justice system or whether the show simply taps an audience that has a prurient interest in violent crimes court tv is judged by its ratings but we also carefully consider the benefits and the context of each show and we believe that it is fair to reveal a part of the criminal justice system the confession that has not been seen to this degree before the show provides insights into the criminal mind and it fuels legitimate debate about issues like capital punishment and the usefulness of confessions yes the confessions of criminals are by their nature unsettling but providing an unfiltered look into this part of the criminal justice system is both logical and appropriate transparency particularly as it applies to our government is an important ingredient of democracy moreover all cases on confessions have been fully adjudicated and are part of the public record they have been provided to us by police departments and prosecutors around the country at the same time we agree that some concerns about the show are legitimate as a result we have decided to air after the show 's premiere an additional half hour discussion of the issues that it raises additionally a web site will provide in depth interpretation and analysis shows like survivor make viewers relatively comfortable because they provide a hollywood produced version of life a show like confessions is more troubling because in fact it provides a true picture of the world in which we live the real world is both good and bad and there is value in seeing both henry schleiff is chairman and chief executive officer of court tv

oops the yankees celebrated too soon on orders from george m steinbrenner the team wanted not to have the major leagues highest opening day payroll and on sunday thought they had achieved their quest when it appeared that the boston red sox were no 1 but yesterday a recalculation based on the present day value of manny ramirez 's contract lowered the red sox total and bumped the yankees into their customary top spot the yankees payroll made up of 25 players on the roster and 6 players on the disabled list is 109801893 boston 's payroll with 25 active and 7 disabled players had been computed at 111505833 including 15 million for ramirez a 13 million salary and a 2 million share of his 16 million signing bonus however when the players association and the labor relations department of major league baseball determine their opening day payrolls the red sox figure will be about 2 million less because part of ramirez 's salary and signing bonus will be deferred without interest the players association reduces the 2001 value to 12932275 while baseball lowers it to 13033075 either figure drops the red sox to approximately 1095 million or 300000 below the yankees murray chass
allen iverson rocked to a rhythm only he could feel tonight stopping and popping fading away to find twine slashing with brash assurance and finishing with soft finger rolls iverson the smallest player on the court at 6 feet tall created an electrical storm every time he touched the ball and then with 159 seconds remaining in game 2 of the eastern conference semifinal series against the toronto raptors iverson the philadelphia 76ers all star guard turned to the first union fans between free throws he cupped his ear to challenge them to yell louder opened his mouth wide flung back his head and roared exhaling the energy that propelled him to his stunning 54 point performance iverson went back to the foul line and added his final point of the night his team 's 19th in a row as the sixers went on to finish off the raptors 97 92 and even the series heading back to toronto at one game apiece tonight it was just a great player having an incredible night sixers coach larry brown said shaking his head it was a pretty inspiring performance in the sixers game 1 defeat iverson hit only 11 of his 34 shots and scored 36 points and he was determined tonight to improve on that he made 21 of 39 shots piling 20 points into the second quarter and 19 of the sixers final 20 points in the fourth his 54 points were a team playoff high and tied the career high he set this season on jan 6 against cleveland when he was taken out of the game for the first time there were only 14 seconds left that 's something you expect every night especially of me iverson said matter of factly last game i took what they gave me they gave me wide open jumpers i took a lot of quick shots and guys were n't in rebounding position i had a lot of time to think about it because i could n't sleep after that first loss i said 'rather than what they give me i 'm not going to look at it like that i will take everything i want do n't settle for anything iverson settled for nothing less than spectacular taking advantage of the raptors surprising lack of a double team i feel like the only player who can stop me is myself he said in the process he left his teammates stunned how many guys are you going to see come into a playoff game and just dominate at 6 feet just doing what you want out on the floor aaron mckie said it 's a beautiful thing it just comes at such a spectacular time with the playoffs an intense atmosphere and everyone chanting 'mvp i 'm lost for words just watching his performance he carried us the whole game eric snow was the only other sixer to score in double figures with 10 points it did not matter toronto 's superstar vince carter scored 28 points but only 4 in the crucial final period which the raptors entered trailing by 2 73 71 when you see those two kids it 's hard to believe the game is in trouble brown said but adding of iverson we just rode the great horse tonight it does n't get much better than that performance with nine minutes remaining and the sixers ahead by just 77 75 iverson scored his team 's next 19 points the teams were tied 80 80 with 7 minutes 50 seconds to play when iverson hit a 3 pointer the sixers would never relinquish their lead he followed with a 12 foot runner a driving finger roll another cool jumper iverson had brought his team back from a 14 point deficit with 10 10 to play in the second quarter with the seconds waning in the first half he rocked from left foot to right conducting a crossover dribble clinic letting toronto 's chris childs watch him like a cat peering up at a dangling ball of yarn iverson at the last second let go a 22 foot jumper and it shimmied down the net as the buzzer sounded finding the perfect groove the sixers led at halftime 49 47 and answered toronto 's rallies each time in the second half the raptors never changed their strategy on iverson we considered it raptors coach lenny wilkens said of a double team a couple of times we wanted to turn him into a double team area but we did n't do it iverson knew with the sixers trailing in the series and trailing early at home that he had to drive the lane and make the open shots you expect to play well every night he said the only thing you care about is getting the win

i do n't know that i will ever receive a formal letter of rejection from the coral gables garden club i know of the rejection only because one of my sponsors for membership told me the reason had nothing to do with the quality of my flower arrangements nor did it stem from my spotty record as a tropical gardener i am a pretty good northern gardener but the tropics have stumped me more than once the reason offered to my sponsor for my rejection was that i was too liberal the club members have a point i spoke out against the war in iraq and i 've been arrested for protesting against other wars and marching for abortion rights and racial justice with this rejection i thus join tim robbins in this strange season he was disinvited to a baseball hall of fame event on similar grounds i join susan sarandon who was disinvited by the united way of tampa bay for antiwar comments i join the poets who were disinvited to the white house because they might have embarrassed the president at least i am in good company being blackballed by the green thumb crowd blue haired or otherwise is a sobering experience but i can change if a dyed in the wool zone 5 gardener can toss away her forcing forsythia picking up her roots and replanting them in the land of the bougainvillea then surely the garden club can consider me again in hopes of having another chance at membership i have thought of renaming my french string beans which are miraculously giving a daily crop perhaps henceforth they should be called liberty beans same for the french lettuces there is really no need to give the lettuce a nationality we can just call it lettuce and leave it at that i could bathe my night blooming jasmine in red white and blue lights and put bunting around the orange jasmine the dozens of bromeliads in my front yard could be a problem they all have spikes of pink flowers might the garden club think shades of joe mccarthy that i am a pinko i am writing a third garden book to spruce up my credentials did i mention that when i first came to town the club featured me as a speaker when i finished speaking the audience clapped in the question and answer session no one asked about politics many people bought the books perhaps they found evidence of my politics in the pages was there something suspicious about the way i mulch are my rock decorations a threat to homeland security perhaps i should write a new book called politically correct gardening in it i could show the single right way to plant hoe seed and compost i would focus on native plants or ones that originated in countries among america 's coalition of the willing i would avoid pink flowers altogether nothing french would be mentioned all plants would have to look good in bunting gardening is my hobby i wanted to join the club because its members know stuff i want to know i 'm not going to get in but i have learned something in the process a good gardener even a liberal one ca n't take this sort of rejection on her gardening kneepad she takes off her gloves puts down her shears and stands up donna schaper senior pastor of the coral gables congregational church is author of the art of spiritual rock gardening

when two fancy and entertaining offenses are featured in a high wire football act the difference in the game often is the defense that clips the wire sending the opponent 's offense tumbling into mistakes and mediocrity the denver defense brought its shears today against st louis the broncos beat the rams 23 16 in a game that was supposed to be a firecracker but dissolved into sporadic sparks yet the game was full of crafty plays and colored by big and punishing hits for the 75710 fans at invesco field at mile high stadium the joy was supplied by the broncos who had the better licks all day long denver limited st louis to 32 rushing yards only 1 yard in the first half running back marshall faulk gained only 19 yards on 10 carries fifteen of those yards came early in the fourth quarter the broncos intercepted rams quarterback kurt warner once and also forced a turnover on a kickoff return but the most important thing they did was keep the rams out of the end zone allowing only faulk 's 3 yard scoring run early in the third quarter leading by 16 13 the broncos stopped the rams on a fourth and 1 pass at the denver 9 late in the third quarter the rams fourth quarter possessions went this way a missed 39 yard field goal attempt and a successful field goal from 39 yards in between denver scored on a 23 yard touchdown pass from quarterback brian griese to wide receiver ed mccaffrey on a drive that featured a conversion on fourth and 1 at the broncos 38 yard line the broncos employing a defense devised by the coordinator ray rhodes pressured the rams offense into a funk this game was for those who are used to getting physical broncos defensive end trevor pryce said linebacker al wilson added it was just one of those situations where you felt unstoppable i do n't care how many yards you get when you do n't score you do n't win warner threw for 315 yards but did not have his usual scoring output teams have gotten a lot of pressure on us with their front four and we have to do a better job with that warner said the rams understandably were in a foul mood they were not about to concede that denver was a better team or even a special team denver played a good game today but basically they made the plays they needed to rams cornerback aeneas williams said we 've got to get everyone playing up to full throttle and in this first game we did n't do that the broncos leaped ahead 10 0 with the rams setting up denver 's first touchdown grant winstrom roughed the punter in denver 's end zone with the penalty the broncos got the ball back and sustained their drive denver drove 97 yards in 13 plays and scored on a 7 yard touchdown pass from griese to rod smith the rams managed only two field goals in the first half and trailed by 16 6 i thought they took the fight to us pretty good in the first half rams coach mike martz said they were more physical than we were they shook us up a bit st louis started the second half with a williams interception that led to faulk 's 3 yard scoring run and st louis ended the third quarter with the ball at the denver 9 facing a fourth and 1 rather than attempt a tying field goal martz went for the jugular the broncos pressure on warner and poor route running by rams fullback chris hetherington he slipped on his release into the right flat although martz said he was pushed thwarted the play in the fourth quarter rams place kicker jeff wilkins 's failed field goal attempt set up the broncos drive that ended with a touchdown catch by mccaffrey the rams found themselves in a hole too deep to crawl out of the critical play was the fourth and 1 15 yard pitch play from griese to the rookie running back clinton portis that ended at the st louis 47 yard line i felt at that time that we could n't get anything going and they are a very explosive football team and if you give them too many chances you 're making a mistake denver coach mike shanahan said i went with a gut feeling we said 'hey let 's try to win it right here we felt we had a play that we had n't shown them in a long time and it might catch them off balance luckily it worked or i 'm sure i would be getting second guessed right now i thought we needed it and i 'm glad the players bailed me out from what could have been a bad call the rams smirked at the broncos play choice because they said it was a play they made popular in the 1999 season denver used it to kill the rams chances it was an excellent play call martz said we ran it in '99 and we kind of put it on the shelf a little bit i guess it 's coming back so are the broncos but thus far the same can not be said for the rams offense everybody may think they have a blueprint on how to beat us now but i would n't say that the rams kim herring said we just have to get back to balance and scoring and winning like on this day the broncos

the knicks have set their sights on the 6 foot 10 inch forward joe smith whose contract with the minnesota timberwolves was voided today by the national basketball association making him a free agent he 's certainly a great player and we certainly have interest in him general manager scott layden said tonight at halftime of the washington wizards 87 86 exhibition victory over the knicks we 'll certainly see if there 's a chance to get him here the knicks are over the salary cap so they can offer smith only the midlevel exception or 225 million a year layden said approximately half of the league 's 29 clubs can make the same offer while a couple of others can offer more dan fegan smith 's agent said that the knicks would be a good fit for his client he 's still looking at his options with other teams but new york is a situation that would suit him fegan said adding that he had spoken to layden tonight smith 25 is entering his sixth season he has averaged 145 points and 75 rebounds a game the no 1 pick in the 1995 draft smith averaged only 99 points and 62 rebounds a game last season as the timberwolves sixth man still smith has great potential and could help the knicks in their area of greatest need rebounding though mainly a power forward he can also play small forward and center particularly in the small eastern conference the miami heat which lost alonzo mourning for the season because of a kidney disorder could be able to offer smith 39 million if the league awards the club a disabled player exception the heat applied for it today the chicago bulls who reportedly have an interest in smith could offer him about 6 million fegan said if smith retained his larry bird rights a provision that allows a team to re sign its own free agent after three years even if the new contract exceeds the salary cap the timberwolves would be his first choice latrell sprewell could play a role in helping the knicks sign smith the two played together at golden state in the 1995 97 seasons and were good friends if he knows we 're interested he 's going to be willing to come said sprewell who called smith tonight i 've seen him quite a bit at minnesota and he 's a very good player layden said of smith he 's matured into a fine player i think he 's improved every year he 's highly skilled yet he does things that help a team win he looks like a guy who can play a number of positions rebounds coach jeff van gundy was upset with the knicks performance wednesday we 've got a lot of things to tighten the screws on he said guys were more worried about the world series than about tonight 's game chris whitney 's 3 pointer with 24 seconds left was the decisive shot for the wizards latrell sprewell who showed up 20 minutes before tip off led the knicks 5 2 with 23 points

what do the defenestrations of paul h o'neill the treasury secretary and lawrence b lindsey the president 's top economic adviser reveal about the economy now its future and that of the stock market about the economy now the moves show how worried president bush is that the nation will slip back into recession the economy is perceived to be a serious problem said jan hatzius senior economist at goldman sachs you would n't need to change the team if there was n't a problem nor would you change the team if you were n't worried about being re elected in 2004 clearly the white house understands that the economy needs strong medicine if it is to stay on its feet and become ambulatory that medicine administered heretofore and only somewhat successfully by alan greenspan will soon be augmented by new tax cuts if mr bush has his way neither mr o'neill nor mr lindsey had the ideas or the credibility to fix the problems so both had to go many economists agree that tax cuts are exactly what the doctor ordered largely because consumer spending the engine of economic growth in recent years is imperiled by excessive borrowing this economy is really laboring under a tremendous debt load said paul kasriel director of economic research at northern trust in chicago the corporate sector has made great strides in slowing down its borrowing but the private sector has n't even started sure enough debt as a percentage of assets among households has reached new highs consumer borrowing was very strong in the third quarter and equity extraction from homes has been enormous the household net worth figures released last week by the federal reserve showing the latest in a string of declines were also ominous prior to 2000 there had never been a year on year decline in household net worth in the postwar period mr kasriel noted it happened in 2000 and 2001 and now 2002 people are going to have to start saving more but increased saving means reduced spending which would in turn drag down the economy so tax cuts are a way to give consumers the cushion they need to save a bit even as they keep spending the problem for mr bush is that his tax cuts of whatever sort are not likely to be enough to counterbalance increased taxes that most consumers will face from their state and local governments which are struggling mightily and because spending at state and local levels is almost double that of federal spending restraint there could damage the economy significantly if you take all levels of government together it is unlikely that the federal government 's stimulus can outweigh the state and local governments restraint mr hatzius said so even if mr bush succeeds in pushing tax cuts through they may not be that effective in propelling the economy as a result mr hatzius and mr kasriel both expect the economy to sputter along next year mr hatzius projects gross domestic product growth of around 2 percent for 2003 while mr kasriel forecasts around 3 percent so where does that leave the stock market stable perhaps but not strapping sluggish gross domestic product growth usually means corporate profits are n't much better than flat mr hatzius said and if corporate profits stagnate stock indexes may too what has gone on in the past two years may well continue individual stocks do well but the indexes disappoint this economy is in hock mr kasriel said it has come off 20 years of extreme leveraging it 's going to take time to work through these things and it wo n't be pleasant
laura davies and meg mallon use different styles to produce winning results one of the longest hitters in women 's golf davies attacks golf courses making every hole and every round a potential adventure mallon does not hit the ball nearly as far but her putting and her imagination make her one of the lpga 's most consistent players with each one on top of her game friday davies and mallon shared the lead heading into saturday 's third round of the season ending adt championship davies 69 and mallon 71 were two under par for the tournament at 142 and three players were tied at one under se ri pak 70 rosie jones 67 and cristie kerr 69 with annika sorenstam 70 lurking in contention at even par 144 the weekend at trump international golf club promises to be competitive davies the world 's best female player during the early 1990 's hoped to make a season ending statement that she remains a force on tour at age 40 before sorenstam before pak before karrie webb davies was the player her competitors feared most obviously when you were considered a champion you do n't like to be forgotten about said davies who has won 4 major championships 20 lpga tournaments and 65 tournaments worldwide but who has not won on tour since 2001 i have very definitely been forgotten about in many respects davies said i am no longer a big fish i am one of the little fish now friday 's round was typical for davies volatile and exciting with seven birdies and four bogeys davies loves golf but do n't tell her that practice makes perfect her disdain for practice rounds is widely known and she did not see the need for a practice round this week they are boring take too long waste of time davies said other than that they are a great idea mallon smiled when she was told that davies had n't practiced she tried to practice i do n't know about six seven eight years ago mallon said she even got lessons it just messed her up when davies bogeyed three of the first six holes friday she dropped to four over for the tournament and she was close to falling out of contention then she made four consecutive birdies starting at no 7 after a par at no 11 davies birdied nos 12 and 13 that stretch of six birdies in seven holes is the kind of streak rarely seen at a course as difficult as trump but those streaks have made davies a fan favorite and a player admired by her peers mallon admitted that she looked forward to playing with davies in saturday 's final group we 're contemporaries said mallon who is six months older than davies we pretty much came out on tour at the same time it 's always interesting always fun always a great conversation you never know what is going to happen with her out there you could n't see two more opposite games but we enjoy playing with each other mallon began the round two strokes behind the first round leader laura diaz but diaz who has been bothered all year by a sore left ankle stumbled to a second round 77 dropping her into a tie for ninth at two over that left first place wide open and mallon and davies were glad to take over mallon who made par on her final eight holes played far more steadily than davies but that was by design i am thinking about what i need to do to win said mallon who has 14 lpga victories but none this year i have been in this position a lot in my career so i have that experience so does laura and annika is only a shot or two back chip shots annika sorenstam 's pinkeye condition which sent her to an emergency room thursday morning improved friday although she again played without contact lenses on saturday sorenstam said she would play with her contact lenses with or without her doctor 's permission rosie jones 's 67 was the low round of the tournament only 5 of the 30 players in the field finished friday 's round under par for the tournament
many people dream about opening their own restaurant in the most common rendition of this fantasy the restaurant is a small place more like a living room with just a few special things on the menu that change according to whim dinner is like a night with friends after a few escapist minutes this fantasy usually passes but not always as in the case of a a tiny place where the kitchen table as restaurant comes to life actually a is more of a lounge than a restaurant with several mismatched formica topped kitchen tables and room for 15 or so any more and the chef marc solomon who owns a with his fiancee blue grant would n't be able to enjoy the fantasy though the menu offers only six dishes at a time mr solomon barely keeps up from his station behind a counter with only a toaster oven and two single burners nonetheless he and ms grant have turned a into an extension of their home greeting everyone who comes through the door a surprising number of whom know mr solomon from past incarnations downtown where he ran a restaurant les deux lapins and a bar red strype a sweet 60 's vibe pervades the premises and when it 's time to leave hugs and kisses abound even if you 're a newcomer as mr solomon says when you 've got only 200 square feet you 've got to love everybody they 've wisely disencumbered themselves of distractions a place to wait there 's a bench outside a wine list bring your own the host appreciates a taste just be sure it 's something you wo n't mind sipping from a drinking glass that leaves mr solomon 's tiny menu the sort of inspired amateur cooking that would make him the best loved member of a college commune 's kitchen broiled snails 8 a half dozen or more are stuffed inside two big conch shells in a bath of oil herbs and plenty of garlic they make a perfect appetizer for a main course of curried lamb pie 10 a delicious caribbean inspired dish of ground lamb in a crisp pastry shell moistened with a thin layer of coconut creme fraiche and crowned with tossed greens those are by far the two best dishes a notch below are a rustic chunky rabbit pate 9 served with figs olives and cornichons and an equally nice hors d'oeuvre a roasted pear stuffed with goat cheese 9 trailing the pack are a vegetarian crepe 10 stuffed with ackee a bland caribbean fruit and calaloo a spinachlike leaf which is too dry despite a mango salsa warmed camembert 8 topped with grapes and grape tomatoes is a runny failure to me but seems nonetheless popular judging by how the room is continually perfumed by melting cheese there are two desserts 6 each that are quite good made by a friend of mr solomon 's one is a dense chocolate and coffee cheesecake that actually tastes like fine espresso while the other is a subtle peach and mango cake you might wonder why mr solomon and ms grant call their restaurant a the restaurant takes its logo from the a train and the dining room is decorated with subway maps which may seem curious since the a stops nowhere nearby maybe in their fantasy all trains lead to a a 947 columbus avenue near 106th street manhattan 212 531 1643 best dishes broiled snails in garlic sauce curried lamb pie rabbit pate roasted pear with goat cheese chocolate coffee cheesecake peach mango cake price range savory dishes 8 to 10 desserts 6 credit cards cash only hours lunch thursday and friday 11 30 am to 4 pm dinner tuesday through saturday 6 to 10 pm brunch saturday and sunday noon to 5 pm wheelchair access tightly packed tables narrow entrance to restroom
talk about mixed signals george w bush 's top economic adviser lawrence lindsey has been warning for some time that the stock market is dangerously overvalued that it 's a bubble that is bound to burst and more likely sooner than later mr lindsey who strongly favors mr bush 's proposed 13 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession he said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able to sleep at night that 's one signal the other signal came monday when mr bush told the nation that the key to saving social security retirement benefits was to allow working americans to invest a portion of their social security taxes in the very same stock market that mr lindsey at the moment wants no part of deciphering this can get confusing it 's as difficult in its way as picking winners in the market or figuring the odds at the craps table in atlantic city or vegas do you feel lucky what bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non guaranteed non indexed system that 's based on the luck of the stock market said roger hickey co director of the campaign for america 's future a progressive policy organization in washington even if mr bush 's bet is right that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick the stock market by definition has winners and losers even in the best of times you could have pretty good returns in the market on average said mr hickey but with a large number of individuals doing very poorly you could also have two people working side by side making the same money in a job and then one retires at a time the stock market is flush and the other retires a couple of years later when the stock market is crashing and people are losing their shirts there is however a group of guaranteed winners under mr bush 's plan the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of mr bush and other politicians just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in social security taxes their way everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the not so idle rich face it the republicans have had it in for social security since its inception the historian william manchester wrote about the gop 's desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation on radio spots actors hired by the republican national committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number as though there were any other way to keep track of social security accounts and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted when the republicans won control of congress in 1946 party leaders called for the repeal of social security and nearly four decades later governor bush 's fellow texan senator phil gramm could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly they are 80 year olds most people do n't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old so it 's hard for me to feel sorry for them governor bush is trying to be a new kind of republican a new kind of conservative a man who masks his party 's traditionally harsh policies with a winning smile oh he 's a charmer but look closely at what he is saying first we must not change social security for those now retired or nearing retirement let me put this plainly for those on social security or close to receiving it nothing will change government has made a commitment and you have made your plans these promises will be honored so those who are retired or close to being retired are safe the rest of you as far as i can tell should look out

to the editor deciding on executive pay lack of independence seen front page dec 18 relates high executive pay to conflicts of interest while these may be contributing factors there is another mechanism that operates even in the absence of such conflicts company boards are composed largely of highly paid people like chief executives of other companies one can easily believe that in view of their own high compensation they see nothing wrong in approving comparable compensation for other executives or to put it less charitably they approve high compensation packages to justify their own compensation david w kraft briarcliff manor ny dec 18 2002

with army at 0 5 and texas christian at 4 1 after four consecutive victories today 's game at michie stadium shaped up as a blowout army 's prospects seemed all the more bleak because the horned frogs came into the game ranked seventh in the nation in turnover margin army was 114th and seventh in rushing defense but going into the fourth quarter on a dank rainy day before a crowd of 32454 army trailed by only 5 points tcu added two more touchdowns in the last quarter to hand the black knights a 46 27 defeat army 0 4 conference usa got an offensive boost with the return of the sophomore quarterback reggie nevels who had not played since sustaining a hamstring injury in the season opener nevels connected on 8 of 17 passes for 104 yards and a touchdown and ran 15 times for a team high 65 yards while scoring one touchdown but nevels threw two interceptions one of which led to a field goal i did feel rusty at the beginning of the game nevels said recovering from a hamstring injury takes away from your conditioning and conditioning affects mental attitude nevels was overshadowed by tcu 's tye gunn a redshirt freshman quarterback who was filling in for the injured starter sean stilley gunn connected on 12 of 15 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown and scrambled 15 times for 33 yards over all we were certainly better than we were at east carolina army coach todd berry said alluding to his team 's 59 24 defeat last saturday i just wish there had been more consistency on both sides of the ball we just seem to find ways to sabotage ourselves one of those ways berry said was when punter chris castelli had to field a snap from jason frazier on a bounce in the end zone in the fourth quarter with army trailing 32 27 castelli ran the ball rather than risk a blocked punt that gave the horned frogs the ball at the army 6 and three plays later reggie holts scored from the 1 to widen tcu 's lead to 39 27 army kept the game close during the first half largely because of mistakes by texas christian 2 1 in the conference after the horned frogs took the opening kickoff and drove 67 yards for their first touchdown army recovered a fumble at its 37 and drove 63 yards to tie the score at 7 7 the touchdown a 20 yard run by the freshman running back carlton jones was army 's first in the opening quarter this season but then tcu scored on its next four possessions field goals of 31 32 and 33 yards by nick browne and a 46 yard pass from gunn to wide receiver adrian madise to go ahead by 23 7 with 4 minutes 18 seconds left in the opening half madise 's touchdown came after a 19 yard punt by castelli gave tcu possession at the army 46 browne 's third field goal his 15th in 16 attempts this season followed an interception at the army 22 army got another break with 57 seconds left in the half when the snap sailed through the hands of texas christian punter joe biasatti biasatti fell on the ball at the horned frogs 2 yard line where army took possession with 36 seconds remaining in the half two plays later nevels flashed through right tackle for his first career touchdown paul stelzer 's conversion attempt was blocked but army had cut the deficit to 23 13 another texas christian miscue led to army 's third touchdown early in the third period army 's mario price recovered a fumbled punt at the texas christian 40 marcellus chapman capped the ensuing scoring drive by scoring from 3 yards to make it 23 20 texas christian increased its lead to 5 points when zac dahman the backup army quarterback was called for intentional grounding in the end zone resulting in a safety after the free kick lonta hobbs banged in from 3 yards out to cap a 31 yard drive giving tcu a 32 20 lead
the government ratified an important united nations human rights treaty today even as its own rights record has continued to come under increasing international criticism and scrutiny the standing committee of the national people 's congress approved the international convention on economic social and cultural rights a day after the united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson visited china but the government 's brief official announcement suggested that it might hedge on a full commitment to the part of the treaty that is the biggest problem for china article 8 which proclaims the right to form and join free labor unions according to the new china news agency the lawmaking body agreed to assume the obligations prescribed in item 1 a of article 8 in line with provisions of china 's constitution trade union law and labor law the law recognizes just one union which is state sanctioned and prohibits the formation of independent groups the constitution does not recognize the right to strike china has jailed dozens of people for independent labor activity on the one hand this is a big step forward mike jendrzejczyk of human rights watch in washington said but it makes it even more urgent now that china bring its labor laws into compliance with international labor laws and practices the chinese clearly hope that the ratification will sway two votes on march 19 a united nations human rights meeting in geneva will vote on whether to censure china for its continuing problems perhaps more important to china 's leaders in july the international olympic committee will decide whether to give beijing the 2008 summer games a spokesman for the high commissioner 's office in geneva jose diaz said it had not received the official documents from china and could not yet comment mr diaz said a clarification of the chinese position could take time although it is in their interest to do it quickly on tuesday ms robinson said a serious reservation on article 8 would be extremely disappointing the convention allows member countries to enter reservations on treaty clauses indicating that such parts will not be followed united nations officials said it was not clear whether china was planning to enter a reservation to the union clause or if it was merely signaling its intent to interpret the clause still ms robinson said the ratification would be enormously important legally and psychologically for china providing a real tool and a framework for progress in rights because it mandates periodic united nations evaluations of china 's record including its labor practices the convention 's goals include safe work places free compulsory primary education and equal pay for women members are subject to periodic united nations inspections even if china does not register a reservation the treaty gives countries fairly wide discretion in carrying out its terms the article states that no restrictions may be placed on the right to organize other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others this week china indicated it was not close to signing what is considered in the west to be a more important convention the accord the convention on civil and political rights enshrines rights like universal suffrage freedom of association and freedom to live where one chooses
once again kenyans have found themselves caught in the middle of a war that is not their own television images broadcast throughout kenya today showed the charred remains of a building brought down by a bomb a frantic search and rescue effort and victims carried away to hospitals and the morgue the attack on the paradise hotel in the coastal resort city of mombasa was eerily reminiscent of the even deadlier attack four years ago on the united states embassy in the capital nairobi in both cases innocent kenyans made up the bulk of the casualties in both cases as well it appeared that kenya was the venue but that the driving force was international politics that had little to do with east africa mombasa is home to most of kenya 's muslims who generally mix easily with the majority christians especially when the situation there is compared with that of kenya 's strife ridden neighbor sudan as well as a beach paradise the city is a bustling port linking kenya to the middle east mombasa 's islamic culture is strong with some streets emptying out at prayer time and islamic dress commonplace just as in nigeria muslims in mombasa spoke out against the miss world pageant calling on miss kenya not to take part but after issuing their statement mombasa 's muslims largely stayed quiet the latest bombing aimed at israelis is sure to increase calls among some kenyans for their country one of america 's staunchest military allies in africa to distance itself from the policies of washington after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon last year president daniel arap moi of kenya whom the united states has criticized for his autocratic ways but embraced for his consistent backing of american policies marched down the street in a show of support the gesture was intended to counter muslim protests in nairobi in which the united states was denounced as evil when muslims marched in the direction of the israeli embassy in nairobi mr moi dispatched security forces to break up the demonstrations and stationed full time soldiers at the embassy 's front gate the relationship between the united states and kenya especially when it comes to military matters is close the american military operated from kenya during the 1991 persian gulf war and again during the ill fated relief mission in somalia in 1994 german and british surveillance planes supporting the united states led campaign against terrorism are currently using mombasa as a base as they search the seas off somalia for any fleeing qaeda operatives islamic leaders based along kenya 's coast have spoken out publicly against such operations as have some victims of the embassy bombing in 1998 which killed 12 americans and 247 kenyans ambassador johnnie carson and others in the american embassy in kenya have worked in recent months to soothe tensions between the united states and kenya 's large muslim population american diplomats have shown up regularly at cultural festivals and sponsored town meetings in recent months the united states has also provided money to train kenya 's airport workers in security screening and to upgrade equipment at airports the united states has also spent millions of dollars rebuilding structures in nairobi that were damaged in the 1998 embassy blast and paid medical bills for wounded kenyans and school fees for victims families but the compensation given to kenyans was nowhere near as generous as that offered by congress to the families of the americans who died in the sept 11 attacks in the united states and lawsuits have been filed by kenyans to gain more assistance only if americans are superior victims can the disparity explained paul wala chairman of a survivors association said at a recent news conference i was just walking down the street and america 's foreign policies caused me to get knocked down and hurt another victim said recently i had nothing to do with it with today 's attack at mombasa more kenyans have fallen victim in a global war in which they were not fighting

complaints that the rev robert v gale was molesting young boys first reached the attention of the roman catholic archdiocese of boston in 1979 there were more reports and concerns raised about sexual abuse in 1981 1983 and 1987 but according to documents released today which described the complaints it was not until 1991 that the archdiocese removed father gale from parish ministry then father gale was allowed to live at another church where in 1994 more accusations were made the documents are part of 252 pages of church records concerning five priests who have been accused of sexual abuse the papers were released today by lawyers for some 250 people who say they were abused by priests in many cases the complaints were handled by some of the highest ranking archdiocesan officials including bishop thomas v daily who now heads the brooklyn diocese the rev john b mccormack who is now bishop of new hampshire and bishop robert j banks who is now bishop of green bay wis in 1981 the rev george rosencranz was arrested after a security guard in a sears roebuck store discovered him performing sexual acts with a young man in a restroom stall according to a memorandum written by bishop daily bishop daily wrote that father rosencranz denied the accusations and expressed concern to me about his effectiveness at the parish if people know or heard of allegation etc i told him in light of his protestation of innocence i would support him bishop daily also wrote that we ca n't contact the news media and added that priests are vulnerable father rosencranz was allowed to return to his parish and the charges against him were dismissed the notes from bishop daily suggest that the police might not have charged father rosencranz if they had known he was a priest in 1987 the archdiocese received another complaint from a former parishioner who accused father rosencranz of making sexual advances 18 years earlier he was briefly sent for treatment but later bishop banks wrote that the church had determined there is no reason to pursue this matter any further because the person making the charge was unable to provide any corroborating evidence in 1989 father rosencranz was arrested in a state park in north andover mass charged with indecent assault after he tried to touch the crotch of an undercover police officer after the arrest father rosencranz was placed on sick leave the archdiocese 's way of quietly removing him from ministry donna m morrisey a spokeswoman for the boston archdiocese said she could not comment on the cases because they were in litigation calls to a spokesman for bishop daily were not returned spokesmen for bishop banks and bishop mccormack cited the difficulties of commenting on personnel documents they had not seen in a statement bishop banks added i can only say that i always tried to deal fairly with both the priests and those alleging abuse in 1979 bishop daily was told that father gale a pastor at st joseph 's church in quincy molested two boys and father gale admitted to one accusation bishop daily told that the parents were ready to take their cases to prosecutors removed him from st joseph 's but father gale was transferred to another parish st jude in waltham and allowed to supervise altar boys three of whom complained in 1981 including one boy who said the priest had put his hand down the boy 's pants father gale told bishop daily he had black outs and did not remember the incident father gale was allowed to remain at the waltham church for seven years he was removed after more accusations but was transferred to a church in brookline in the 1980 's he was accused of molesting boys at a church run camp in new hampshire in 1991 father gale was removed from the brookline church apparently because of a drinking problem according to a report in the boston globe he moved into a south boston rectory but in 1994 the archdiocese received an accusation that he had kissed a teenager on the mouth at a christening in 1995 and 1996 with the archdiocese trying to settle lawsuits concerning father gale the church agreed not to allow him unsupervised access to children the documents show last month father gale was arrested and charged with four counts of raping an altar boy at the waltham church from 1980 to 1984
to the editor i take issue with an oct 11 letter saying that overturning roe v wade would not end a woman 's right to choose in fact the overturning of roe would transfer the right of choice to politicians who would exercise it based on the success of various electoral strategies some women would retain the ability to have an abortion either pursuant to the law of their state or in avoidance of that law through travel or other means no american woman would have a right to reproductive self determination unless guaranteed by her state constitution since the right does not travel with her she would have to be at home to be sure of exercising that right mae kuykendall east lansing mich oct 11 2000 the writer is a professor at michigan state university detroit college of law

it took only one game into the second half of the season for the nets world they lead the atlantic division by four games to seem uncertain a 105 103 loss to the atlanta hawks at philips arena tonight included an injury scare to the nets starting power forward kenyon martin martin injured his right wrist in the second quarter he said he did not know how though he returned to the game he attempted only dunks in the second half it 's really sore martin said later mike bernot the hawks orthopedist gave martin the best news of the night for the nets x rays revealed that he had a bruise that left the nets to focus on how this game got away with 3 minutes 28 seconds remaining they were ahead by 101 94 and all signs pointed to victory but that was before the hawks scored 11 of the game 's final 13 points still the nets had possession of the ball with 44 seconds left they inbounded to point guard jason kidd whose 3 point attempt could have won it the ball bounced off the back of the rim i had a good look kidd said i would take that shot again if i had it the loss which dropped the nets to 32 16 left coach byron scott in a sour mood scott said the nets terrific first half of the season had put a target on our back as teams tried harder to defeat them we gave this game away basically scott said guard jason terry 's two free throws with 44 seconds left won the game for atlanta 17 33 he finished with 28 points shareef abdur rahim had a game high 34 shooting guard kerry kittles led the nets with 20 points kidd had 12 points 14 rebounds and 9 assists we did n't shut the door kidd said this was still a dress rehearsal for us we 're still learning how to play together kerry kittles 's three baskets gave the nets a 6 4 lead but they were undermined by a torrent of mistakes when kittles threw a pass away that led to nazr mohammed 's dunk and a 23 12 hawks lead all five nets starters had committed a turnover add to those woes the fact that martin incurred his second foul five minutes into the game as kidd began to warm up so did the nets held to no points or assists in the first quarter kidd scored 6 points in the second quarter with 6 rebounds an assist and a steal not coincidentally the nets forged a 57 56 halftime lead forward richard jefferson also came alive scoring 13 of his 15 points after martin was called for his third foul with 7 02 left in the half by scoring 11 of the quarter 's first 13 points the nets tied the game at 39 39 on jefferson 's drive and free throw from there the lead changed eight times the nets finished strong with jefferson making a jump shot and kidd dribbling through atlanta 's interior defense for a runner with 26 seconds left kidd also put together a highlight film during one span of the third quarter he made a 3 point shot then displayed his passing skills he fed kittles with a 30 foot pass for a layup and ended a fast break with a behind the back pass to keith van horn for another layup then came the topper a perfect alley oop pass to martin that led to a thunderous dunk the nets seemed on the way to an easy victory but terry would not allow it he had 13 points in the quarter offsetting aaron williams 's 5 points which gave the nets an 82 78 lead as it turned out though the game was a long way from over

to the editor re nuclear breakout editorial july 27 you correctly identify the cause of the alarming spread of nuclear weapons as the loophole that lets countries manufacture bomb fuel under the guise of civilian power programs but the nuclear nonproliferation treaty does not need to be strengthened to deal with this problem its current language is more than adequate what is lacking is the will of the major nuclear industrial states the united states france britain germany and japan in particular to stop the peaceful use of these deadly materials in their own countries if such a consensus could be established the matter of outlawing their use worldwide could be brought to the united nations security council and political muscle applied to bring russia and china along the problem since the late 1970 's has been the rejection of nuclear proliferation prevention by the bureaucratic and industrial circles and think tanks that formulate nuclear policy in favor of proliferation management despite all its obvious failures paul l leventhal washington july 27 2003 the writer is founding president of the nuclear control institute

cosmologist professor of mathematics and physics duke university in the coming years cosmologists are likely to find more information to reinforce einstein 's general theory of relativity or as some believe we may discover from research on the largest scales in the cosmos that general relativity needs to be modified general relativity will likely be reinforced in the not too distant future by observations of the supermassive black hole believed to lie at the center of our galaxy on the largest scales how general relativity performs will hinge on what we learn about the dark side dark energy and dark matter which are invisible and comprise about 95 percent of the universe the dark energy is about 70 percent and dark matter about 25 percent though we have a theory about dark matter the nature of this dark energy is a mystery

the town of hempstead 's housing code piece by piece to a new nassau feb 16 is toothless the only way to put pressure on the homeowner with an illegal apartment is for the town of hempstead to mail a formal questionnaire the questionnaire would require the homeowner to answer yes or no to having an illegal rental under penalty of perjury and a hefty fine the town of hempstead has an official population of 760000 and a hidden population of 20 percent or 150000 people who are illegal renters these people vote on the school budget increase the school population burden the facilities of the county the town and special districts and clog the roads with overnight parking but pay no property or school taxes since this problem has been ignored for too long by our elected officials evicting 150000 people into the street without affordable housing available is irresponsible the only solution is to replace the present school and property taxes with an equitable residency income tax and let all the people pick up the cost not just the homeowners joseph m sardone franklin square
to the editor re the presidential pen editorial aug 8 i for one am looking forward to bill clinton 's book and hope that it includes very few words about monica s lewinsky and many about his foreign policy initiatives we seemed much closer to living in a peaceful world where problems between countries were addressed through negotiations where our power was used in helpful even modest ways not assuming we had all the answers i want to hear his views about foreign leaders and his efforts to rescue the economy being quickly undone by the current resident of the white house and i want to hear more about how he chose to deal with the right wingers working against him a highly intelligent president with a deep and broad world view will have a lot to tell us jane levy troy new york aug 8 2001

todd zeile has heard the grumbling in dugouts around baseball the yankees get every call in yankee stadium the ball always bounces the yankees way and every time the yankees stock up on talent during the season you hear sarcastic shows of emotion zeile admitted zeile is quick to add that he never indulged in those sour grapes himself and now he has been rewarded with a tour of duty with the rich and talented and dominating and perpetual yankees he was in the lineup yesterday as the yankees beat toronto 4 0 to improve their record to 12 victories and 3 losses the yankees have not won a world series in two years now but they are the champions all the same they have now tied the best start in the history of the club just when the underclass of the north american baseball world thought the yankee domination could not possibly get worse this pitching staff looks like it could win oh let 's be conservative 120 or 130 games this season the scary part is that the yankees are not even getting much from about 50 million worth of their payroll what with derek jeter mariano rivera and steve karsay injured and sterling hitchcock and jose contreras hardly contributing for the yankees 50 million is a mere offering to placate the baseball gods the yankees are loaded in cable income and in the dugout jeter gets hurt erick almonte hits a home run in his first start the young shortstop does look a little shaky right now but the yanks can carry him a long way the outfield looks a little shaky hideki matsui comes along with professional skills and even a wry sense of humor some starters may not last forever jeff weaver threw 120 pitches yesterday to show that the near future may be very much like the recent past some people think none of this is fair even some people in opposing dugouts think it is n't fair i always felt you were playing more than that particular team said zeile now with his 10th team making it sound as if billy martin were chasing windblown pop ups and elston howard were hitting one into the gap and so on and so on zeile and his fellow emigre robin ventura say they never resented the yankees domination when they were on the other side rather they respected the yankees for what they were and what they did you look at them ventura said yesterday on his day off they had a lot of players come up through the system jeter bernie mariano jorge they saw something in tino to replace mattingly and a lot of it has to do with joe full names are not necessary for this cast of characters now part of the ever expanding yankee legend ventura came along with the white sox while the yankees were down in the early 90 's by the time he got to the world series with the mets in 2000 the yankees were back to demoralizing everybody who came along we felt we could play with them ventura said recalling bobby valentine 's scrappy band way back when that hopeful state was dissipated in the first game the mets had a 3 2 lead with one out in the bottom of the ninth and armando benitez had a 1 2 count on paul o'neill who then obsessively fouled off four pitches we started to think 'we really need to get this guy out ventura recalled instead o'neill walked on the 10th pitch scored the tying run and the yankees won the world series in five games that one at bat by paul set a tone ventura recalled they have the end result it is a collection of doing things right the yankees new dynasty is not merely about money but about making the right choices the mets let ventura and zeile get away spent foolishly and are now looking like 1962 ineptitude at 2003 prices meanwhile ventura and now zeile have moved seamlessly into the yankee clubhouse just like dozens of other lifers when they won the bronx lottery for a season or two everybody wants to wear the uniform unless you 're a dyed in the wool red sox fan or something zeile said you feel you are fortunate to wear the uniform most teams just ca n't break the barrier zeile added there 's a mental edge the latest example came on this homestand now ended we were down 5 0 then it was 5 5 ventura said talking about wednesday 's game the yankees ultimately lost but yesterday they dominated it has happened before it seems to be happening again

with security at its tightest levels in a year at government installations in the united states and abroad the first anniversary of the hijackings passed without serious incident today but senior administration officials continued to warn of the possibility of an attack on a day when federal authorities girded for the worst when emergency command posts at government agencies were heavily staffed by intelligence and law enforcement officials the day offered more tedium than tension we 're tearing around but it 's just really quiet out there said one senior law enforcement official teams of federal agents some with radiation detection gear scoured a liberian flagged cargo ship that was detained off the port newark elizabeth marine terminal the ship was stopped before it was to dock when traces of radioactivity were detected in its cargo and unexplained sounds possibly from stowaways were heard in the vessel 's cargo areas the ship m v palermo senator was ordered to a security zone six miles out to sea in columbus ohio police evacuated the 41 story james a rhodes state office tower after an employee encountered a man behaving suspiciously on the 28th floor when questioned by the employee the man said he was looking for someplace to hide a bomb said lt gary lewis a state police spokesman state police and federal bomb experts cleared the building and began searching a van belonging to the man 's employer bomb sniffing dogs reacted on several occasions to substances in the van but the authorities did not find a bomb the suspect oscar sesmas 35 was charged with inducing panic a felony it has been a somewhat busy day across the country said gordon johndroe spokesman for the white house office of homeland security there were daily reports of incidents across the country mr johndroe said but the volume had been slightly higher today while we have no incidents that immediately indicate terrorism there are some people who are being interviewed by authorities to track all information down necessary to conclude the investigations he said mr johndroe said the increased reporting might have been the result of nervousness on the part of citizens and greater numbers of law enforcement officers deployed to protect memorial gatherings air combat patrols which resumed over washington and new york last friday expanded today to include about 10 additional cities military officials said fighter jets were placed on alert at more than a dozen other locations increased police presence was visible in cities around the country missile launchers were positioned around washington and federal and city police were out in force around the monuments in los angeles city police were at full deployment throughout the day in part because of the federal action and in part to monitor the numerous commemorative events taking place citywide evidence of the bush administration 's edgy observance of the sept 11 hijackings was most noticeable abroad nine american embassies remained shut including diplomatic posts in southeast asia it was the possibility of al qaeda attacks in that region that prompted the bush administration on tuesday to ratchet up the threat alert level the level was raised to code orange the second highest risk level in the color coded threat warning system today the precautionary steps spread throughout the world pentagon officials said that commanders in charge of a region that sweeps from east africa to central asia increased its security level to the military 's highest threat level in europe three embassies and four consulates received envelopes in the mail containing an unidentified white powder government officials said none of the diplomatic posts were closed in each case officials removed the powder and envelopes to a secure location and tests were planned to determine whether the powder was anthrax or another lethal substance the official said the identities of the countries that received the envelopes were not disclosed but an embassy official in rome said that one of the mailings had been received there some time this morning late in the morning we got a batch of international mail not diplomatic not military from outside italy there was a letter addressed generically to the embassy which is unusual in itself when the mailroom people picked up the letter they could tell there was some kind of granular stuff inside other countries also reacted to the threat warnings british officials closed their embassies in jakarta and singapore as a precautionary measure an official said australia closed its embassy in east timor the former indonesian province that acquired its independence earlier this year and closed except for emergencies in singapore as western governments continued to investigate the intelligence that led to the concerns about a terrorist attack they are finding parallels to a plot to blow up the american british and australian embassies in singapore last year western officials said today that plot which was thwarted was the work of jemaah islamiyah a militant organization with deep roots in indonesia officials said they have shown a sophistication and level of capability to carry out an attack like this said a western diplomat in singapore speaking about the current threat they have to be taken very seriously australian officials said that jemaah islamiyah which is headed by an indonesian cleric abu bakar bashir was behind the threats that led to the decision to close their embassy in east timor the australian and british embassies in singapore flank the american embassy which remained open today following a brief outdoors memorial ceremony diplomats said the american embassy was better protected higher on a hill and a virtual fortress while the two other embassies were more vulnerable mr johndroe did not say when the threat condition would return to its previous alert level but many local and state officials said they intended to return to normal police staffing levels on thursday gov gary locke of washington said that he had already ordered more state police staffing for the sept 11 ceremonies before the federal government ratcheted up its threat assessment he said he planned to return duty rosters to normal on thursday or friday no one can guarantee there wo n't be an attack in their own community at some point mr locke said but if there is we 're much better prepared to prevent or respond to such an attack than we were before sept 11

a generation gap apparently must still be bridged on the devils exciting new line left wing patrik elias referred to center joe nieuwendyk recently as mr nieuwendyk as if he were playing next to gordie howe i manage when i play with mr nieuwendyk elias said elias was joking but only a little he holds nieuwendyk nearly 10 years older than elias in high esteem nieuwendyk might have scored 357 more goals than elias in the national hockey league but they have quickly discovered that they play the game in a remarkably similar way we make decisions that are good for the line nieuwendyk said we do n't get ourselves in too much trouble out there add the industrious right wing jamie langenbrunner who often played on the same line with nieuwendyk before the devils acquired them last week from dallas and the devils have a unit that is quick smart and resourceful nieuwendyk 's line had two goals and three assists in a 3 1 victory monday night over florida but there is intrigue line combinations are meant to be broken elias played with jason arnott and petr sykora on the devils a line which stayed together for most of three seasons before arnott was included in the deal for nieuwendyk and langenbrunner sykora came down with the flu last week and has not played since nieuwendyk joined the devils who play the pittsburgh penguins on wednesday night coach kevin constantine who is not much for making commitments said that elias was put on nieuwendyk 's line because there was nowhere else to put him for now we 're still not sure where we want him in the end constantine said of elias a good problem for a coach to have appears to be simmering the devils 33 26 9 4 just 2 points behind the islanders for sixth place in the eastern conference appear to have too many good players nieuwendyk 35 and langenbrunner 26 road roommates with the stars have played even better together in four games with the devils than they did in dallas it 's made a world of difference i 'm sure langenbrunner said of playing next to nieuwendyk the devils best line recently center bobby holik and wings scott gomez and sergei brylin does not appear likely to be broken up that leaves one spot open on the top two lines for elias and sykora and elias has it for now elias was asked if he might really need a big tough center someone like arnott to establish a physical presence he shrugged then said of playing next to nieuwendyk i do n't think we missed anything on the physical side to be honest with you maybe elias said the days of the a line were meant to end because we did n't have the confidence that we 'd had in the last couple of years we threw the puck away instead of hanging on to it elias said besides langenbrunner can supply the grit nieuwendyk fed elias for a goal monday on a beautiful play in which elias faked a slap shot to get florida goaltender trevor kidd out of position then tucked the puck into an open net that goal came on the first shift of the second period on the first shift of the third period nieuwendyk fed elias with a pass through the slot kidd stopped elias but langenbrunner popped in the rebound for the winning goal i think you could put a lot of people with patrik and they 'd feel comfortable nieuwendyk said elias sounds as if he feels the same way about his new linemates even though they may soon become old linemates we 're all on the same page langenbrunner said we want to do the same things with the puck
loughran john b mourn loss of classmate former law partner friend and gentle righteous person lloyd isler
for 11 consecutive years bob huggins has taken cincinnati to the ncaa tournament it is a rite of spring in american sport the bearcats arrive every march with a wealth of talent and a gaudy dazzling record this year for the first time cincinnati was also awarded a no 1 seeding and then on thursday for the eighth successive year cincinnati won its first tournament game on the eve of today 's game with ucla with a wide uncharacteristic grin huggins said jokingly that the top seeding and maybe st patrick 's day would bring his team luck but not every spring custom involving cincinnati and the ncaa tournament delivers a smile to huggins 's face most times in fact march ultimately leaves him grumpy today for the fifth time in six years huggins 's bearcats were eliminated from the ncaa tournament in the second round squandering an 11 point second half lead cincinnati became the first top seeded team of the 2002 tournament to lose as the bearcats fell in double overtime to ucla 105 101 at mellon arena although once again one of the most gifted teams with an all american senior guard in steve logan who led the bearcats beyond modest preseason predictions cincinnati will nonetheless be going home far earlier than expected i just wish we could get a bounce or a break in this tournament something to go our way huggins said there will be other interpretations of how and why cincinnati 31 4 lost ucla for example played with more passion and energy in the game 's closing stages the bruins were deeper had fresher legs got brilliant performances from their stars when cincinnati did not and dominated the tall cincinnati front line late in the game while cincinnati had the experience in the backcourt it was ucla 's two freshman point guards cedric bozeman and ryan walcott who played the entire 50 minutes without a turnover ucla 21 11 came into the tournament with losses in four of its previous six games but its recent tournament experience is the reverse of cincinnati 's ucla is one of three colleges duke and kentucky are the others that has advanced to the round of 16 in four of the last five seasons ucla coach steve lavin is 5 0 in second round games during his six seasons with the team we 've had a strange up and down year said lavin whose team will play 12th seeded missouri in the west regional semifinals on thursday in san jose calif we 've been trying to blend senior veteran players and these skilled and talented freshman it 's been tough sometimes but i think the mix of older and younger may be finally paying off cincinnati 's leonard stokes had 39 points in large part because ucla was focusing its defense on logan but ultimately stokes tired and his shots stopped falling late in the game when it was logan 's turn to resurrect cincinnati he had no answers logan missed two open shots near the end of regulation and made only one a meaningless 3 pointer in the final moments in the overtime periods he finished with 18 points but was 6 for 18 from the floor as cincinnati was sagging ucla was surging although cincinnati appeared to have the game in control with a 65 54 lead with 9 minutes 25 seconds to play in regulation ucla 's matt barnes helped the bruins charge back into the game with back to back 3 point shots that cut the bearcats lead to 65 60 the lead remained 5 points until a put back by barnes and a 3 point shot by jason kapono tied the score 71 71 ucla appeared the stronger more confident team thereafter especially under the basket while cincinnati had controlled the boards with 13 offensive rebounds that led to 17 second chance points in the first half ucla adjusted in the second half playing a more traditional zone defense and worrying less about logan ucla outrebounded cincinnati and had 13 second chance points to cincinnati 's 5 as the game wore on ucla 's offense was growing more versatile as cincinnati 's was growing more one dimensional cincinnati rarely worked the ball inside in the game 's final minutes or in overtime for ucla barnes continued to sparkle as a scorer and playmaker and center dan gadzuric had 13 rebounds to go along with his 26 points both teams had chances to win the game at the end of the second half but neither made its final shots it was much the same at the end of the first overtime in the second overtime logan and stokes who each played 46 minutes appeared fatigued as did most of the cincinnati team ucla quickly grabbed a 4 point lead that it extended to 6 in the final minute cincinnati had nothing left for a last charge huggins conceded that his team was probably tired by the second overtime but he focused his lament on the missed opportunities at the end of regulation and on a missed shot by immanuel mcelroy at the end of the first overtime we also had a tip in attempt off that missed shot that could have won the game he said huggins also called ucla the most talented eighth seed in the history of the ncaa tournament their power

to the editor on environmental rules bush sees a balance critics a threat front page feb 23 judges environmental policy in the bush administration in five major areas but the most important factor in any such scorecard should be the effect of these policies on public health during the past decade we have come to better understand the link between utilities emissions and the epidemic rise in childhood asthma we have learned that toxic dumps create community cancer clusters if left unremedied and we know that common chemicals in pesticides disrupt the endocrine system affecting children 's intellectual and physical development the bush administration has yet to move strongly on these environment related health issues the effect on public health should become a priority in any environmental scorecard and in the actions taken by our policy makers robert k musil executive director physicians for social responsibility washington feb 25 2003

the yankees played as if they had a flight to catch tonight and they only wish that were true after sprinting through a 5 3 loss to the baltimore orioles in 2 hours 12 minutes the yankees wondered openly about the wisdom of playing on thursday with hurricane isabel bearing down on this city i 'm sorry we have to play period said david wells who pitched a complete game in the loss it 's not good the city 's closing down the government 's closing down and we 're playing figure that out yankees players were informed this morning that thursday 's game had been moved up to 12 35 pm from 7 05 pm it was little consolation the yankees wanted the orioles to postpone the game and reschedule it for next weekend in new york the orioles who are home through the weekend said today that they believed there was at least a chance the storm would pass a compromise proposal that had been discussed earlier in the week a day night doubleheader today was rejected by the players union said mike mussina the yankees representative so the yankees are left to hope they can play on thursday and fly to florida for a weekend series with the tampa bay devil rays they plan to take a bus to philadelphia after thursday 's game and meet their charter there i do n't really see it first baseman jason giambi said i do n't see the need to get it in especially when they 're shutting down schools and having the navy get their ships out i hope everything works out and everybody 's safe i do n't understand the thinking of what they 're trying to accomplish joe torre the yankees manager had a theory everybody 's scratching their head about why we 're cutting it so close but it 's not our decision torre said later adding when you 're dealing with revenue in today 's game that 's what it comes down to it was windy at times tonight but it did not rain mussina who is scheduled to start thursday in pursuit of his 200th career victory has reasonable expectations for the weather asked if he hopes the wind blows in mussina said i just want to be able to stand out there wells also has 199 career victories but he squandered his chance for no 200 early in the game tonight he retired 18 of his last 19 hitters and the one base runner in that stretch was caught stealing meaning wells faced the minimum from the third out of the second inning through the orioles last batter but he allowed 5 of the first 10 batters to score two on home runs larry bigbie drove a 2 0 pitch over the fence in left for a homer in the first and jay gibbons crushed a high slider over the right field wall on wells 's first pitch in the second four of the next six orioles had hits leading to three more runs wells quickly settled in aiming the ball around the knees keeping it low and satisfying torre i congratulated him on coming back torre said he was down 5 0 and he did n't quit i respect that the yankees had nine hits in six and two thirds innings against baltimore 's eric dubose but scored only in the fourth and seventh juan rivera pulled a two run homer off the foul pole to close the gap to two and chase dubose but that was as close as they got wells who has two more starts left in the regular season said he was not disappointed about failing to become the 99th pitcher with 200 victories it does n't matter wells said i want to win that 's all it does n't matter if i win or somebody else wins mussina has been more introspective talking about the milestone today he listed several prominent pitchers who never reached it including sandy koufax dizzy dean ron guidry and the yankees pitching coach mel stottlemyre stottlemyre was in his 11th season with the yankees and had 164 victories when he started on june 11 1974 in the fourth inning he threw a curveball to the angels frank robinson and felt a pop in his right shoulder it was a torn rotator cuff and stottlemyre pitched two more innings the rest of his career he was done at age 32 as a pitching coach stottlemyre saw david cone and dwight gooden begin sparkling careers that ended shy of 200 to stottlemyre the number carries a special meaning three hundred is way up there at the top but there 's not too many that have won 200 either stottlemyre said that 's a heck of a plateau we have one guy at 300 and two guys going for 200 and all three are still regular starters in a very good rotation still contributing and still very forceful when they go out there mussina who turns 35 in december said he did not know if he would pitch long enough to get to 300 as roger clemens did in june i 'm certainly not getting any younger the strike zone is getting smaller and smaller and the hitters are getting bigger and stronger mussina said am i still going to be as effective three years or seven years from now i do n't know whatever happens mussina said he will have accomplished something important after his next victory to be able to walk away from the game and say you won 200 you know it 's not 300 but it 's certainly something mussina said

to the editor re where birds do n't fly by thomas l friedman column dec 21 i respectfully take issue with the suggestion that being fingerprinted is somehow demeaning tens of millions of american citizens have been fingerprinted simply because they served in the military or were employed in occupations involving the public trust like stock brokering there is no implication that these individuals did anything improper but especially after 9 11 when we were so dramatically reminded of the risks that foreign visitors can present to our national security it is not unreasonable to ask foreigners to be fingerprinted as a condition to receiving a visa edmund r schroeder scarsdale ny dec 21 2003
to the editor charles ogletree op ed aug 18 refers to the striking disparity in the speed of confirmations for female and minority versus white male nominees to the federal courts but as senator orrin hatch the judiciary committee chairman has documented during this congress the percentage of minority and female nominees confirmed by the senate 59 percent and 65 percent respectively is nearly identical to the overall confirmation rate of 64 percent the simple truth is that many republican senators want judges with a legal philosophy different from that held by some of the people whom president clinton has nominated there is nothing surprising or sinister in this roger clegg washington aug 18 2000 the writer is general counsel of the center for equal opportunity

it was only last sunday when the sun finally peeked out that my tomato plants stopped shivering and started to grow so i spent the afternoon putting cages around them imagining that they looked stronger at this show of confidence and planting basil all through their raised bed i do this not only because i love pesto but because i like to believe that basil enhances the tomatoes growth and flavor so do carrots supposedly but i ca n't grow a carrot in this clay soil to save my life companion planting or using one species to bolster the health or production of another has been part of garden folklore for centuries but proving what works which companion plants attract beneficial insects or repel pests and which enrich the soil is about as easy as finding a cure for the common cold it 's almost like the mind body connection if you believe that basil helps your tomatoes it will as arthur o tucker and thomas debaggio point out in the big book of herbs interweave press 2000 the idea was popularized in the united states in the 1940 's with the introduction of french intensive gardening rudolf steiner 's biodynamic principles paid similar attention to the soil and to the exchange of gases nutrients and compounds companion plants a 1943 pamphlet by richard b gregg and a book he wrote in 1966 with helen louise philbrick companion plants and how to use them devin adair 1990 were embraced by organic gardeners determined not to use pesticides and their monthly bible organic gardening magazine published frequent articles on the subject i know because i read the magazine cover to cover in the 1970 's when i first realized i did n't have to rely on the chemical arsenal my father used to grow broccoli i started growing more flowers and herbs right in the vegetable patch the goal long before biodiversity became a buzzword in the environmental movement was to attract beneficial insects though my favorite advice from the magazine was more mechanical than ecological vacuum flea beetles off the spinach in those days i followed the traditional combinations with near religious zeal i planted mint thyme and sage to repel the cabbage moth until the mint started overtaking my garden i sowed basil and borage to discourage the tomato hornworm though later i realized the parasitic wasp that deposited eggs inside the worm did a better job by simply having its larvae devour the hornworm from within and now i wonder if those borage flowers may have attracted the wasps in the first place sometimes i took trowel in hand the hornworms ultimate enemy companion i remember my remorse after killing the black and yellow striped caterpillar that was consuming my dill and parsley the larva of a black swallowtail butterfly i would never know i have also used companion plantings to divert and trap pests discarding the entire plant once heavily infested but then you wonder if you had n't planted that nasturtium for example to draw the aphids away from the broccoli and peppers would the aphids have simply avoided your garden in the first place one year i tried an american indian tradition known as three sisters planting scarlet runner beans up the stalks of sweet corn and letting acorn squash ramble beneath the stalks i had no damage that year from deer and thus believed what i had heard that deer do n't like to step among prickly vines but the food historian william weaver who grows heirloom vegetables in devon pa scoffed at that idea they eat squash believe me he said they love the tender buds corn a heavy nitrogen feeder can benefit from bean plants which take nitrogen from the air and move it to their roots where rhizobia a type of soil bacteria turn it into a form usable by not only the beans but also by other plants using the same soil but it is n't clear whether this is an immediate benefit or one that takes a while which would explain why farmers rotate their fields of corn and beans the traditions are many most unproven peas and carrots do well together but dill inhibits the growth of carrots summer savory helps the beans grow camomile enhances the flavor of cabbages cucumbers and onions robert kourick summed up a number of experiments in designing and maintaining your edible landscaping naturally metamorphic press 1986 one study for example indicated that tansy and catnip reduced colorado potato beetles on potatoes by more than 70 percent in another study catnip reduced green aphids on pepper plants by 91 percent marigold species not the hybrids discouraged nematodes but mr kourick concluded that it was less the one to one side by side effect of raising a certain plant next to another and more a matter of the general benefit of diverse plantings what 's fascinating to me is that in many cases the mechanism was the increase in predators or parasitic wasps mr kourick said last week from his home north of san francisco so it 's good to have a nice flower garden around your vegetables right and i 'm sure those nice flowers and herbs are playing very specific roles but i 'm always wondering which ones

his first shot in his first practice in more than a month was by his own admission pretty awkward but it took nets center todd macculloch no more than an instant to get it right he grabbed his own rebound and laid the ball in a sign that his problems were largely behind him macculloch who had been sidelined since feb 22 with plantar fasciitis a heel injury in his left foot breezed through his first practice since being placed on the injured list and was given clearance to play in sunday 's game against the atlanta hawks it felt pretty good macculloch said i was able to run the court and all we did n't go all that long today but we did some shooting and i had some contact and afterward i did a little bit extra in the post working on my offense and defense with jason collins i was just trying to get back in the flow a little bit macculloch was in uniform for the nets 108 84 victory friday over milwaukee but coach byron scott decided not to play his 7 foot center until after seeing how he held up in a full practice like macculloch scott was pleased he looked good today scott said i wanted to make sure that i was comfortable with him and that he was comfortable and that 's why i thought having him practice today and have him go up and down the court was very important i wanted him to be able to have no doubt that he was fine watching him i did n't see any glitches which means he was n't favoring that foot he was just going up and down the court and not thinking about it scott said macculloch would play sunday but would not start aaron williams will but scott is confident that macculloch can contribute some productive minutes while working his way back into the starting lineup when his chest starts burning after going up and down the court i 'll be able to see it scott said we did n't do enough today in practice for him to get too tired being that he has n't played in a month i 'm sure he 'll be a little anxious and a little excited i 'll try to monitor his minutes a little bit the nets struggled in macculloch 's absence going 7 8 after being acquired from philadelphia during the off season he has proved to be a steady and reliable force inside and is averaging 99 points and 62 rebounds the nets acknowledged they missed him he gave us rebounds blocked shots and points in the paint jason kidd said he can open up the perimeter game for other guys because he can go inside and score or pass he brings a lot to the table we did n't overlook his absence we knew there were some matchups particularly out west where we needed him the important thing is that we held the ship together and are right where we were when he went out scott is happy the nets are happy and macculloch is very happy for him a tough time is at last over this has been the most difficult period of my basketball life he said there have been a lot of mind games going on it was always a case of 'should i sit out or should i play with it at what point do you make a decision it 's been really difficult and i just hope it 's over it appears that it may be the nets a team that was hit with an overwhelming run of injuries last season are hoping to be at full strength for the playoffs now that macculloch is back right now we are playing good basketball and we feel like everybody is getting healthy at the right time scott said getting todd back is another piece of the puzzle one that we were missing rebounds the nets have two games left on their regular season schedule against philadelphia which will be without allen iverson for four to six weeks iverson broke a bone in his hand in friday 's victory against boston philly is a talented team so you ca n't count them out jason kidd said larry brown will get those guys to play look at what happened against boston iverson missed the second half and they still won the nets will probably clinch a spot in the playoffs next week something they have not done in five seasons

a federal judge has ordered that the simon property group be stripped of its control of the mall of america in minnesota saying that the company the nation 's largest retail real estate investment trust breached its fiduciary duty to its canadian partner by secretly arranging to gain an ownership interest in the mall in his ruling issued late wednesday judge paul a magnuson of united states district court in minneapolis ordered simon to sell a 275 percent stake in the mall to its partner triple five a company owned by four brothers raphael nader bahman and eskander ghermezian for 814 million that transaction would put triple five in charge of the mall a 42 million square foot shopping and entertainment complex that is the country 's largest the ghermezians who originated the idea for the mall and were awarded the right to develop the site in 1986 own an even bigger 53 million square foot mall in west edmonton alberta the judge who heard about nine weeks of testimony in the nonjury trial also ordered that triple five replace simon as managing general partner of the mall which is a mile and a half from minneapolis st paul international airport he also increased the ghermezians share of the management fees to 80 percent from 20 percent those fees are about 5 percent of the mall 's annual gross income or 5 million according to the ghermezians lawyer roger james magnuson who is not related to the judge the ruling calls for a special master to determine how much simon owes triple five including net profits resulting from its ownership interest in the mall since 1999 and those from the sale to ikea of a 15 acre site north of the mall in a statement issued yesterday from its indianapolis headquarters simon property said the company believes that the court 's order is legally and factually wrong the statement did not say whether the company would appeal les morris a company spokesman said only that the court order contained many inaccuracies but declined to elaborate simon now owns or has an interest in 239 properties in 36 states in conjunction with westfield america another shopping center developer simon has been engaged in a battle to take over a rival mall empire taubman centers for 174 billion simon 's shares closed at 4336 yesterday up 08 percent from 4315 mr magnuson a partner with dorsey whitney said his clients would add value to the mall but he said he did not expect the ghermezians to replace all of simon 's managers they do n't want to rattle any sabers or rock the boat he said nader ghermezian said in a statement that the company expected a smooth harmonious transition and a cooperative relationship with our partners the partners plan to expand the mall by developing a 43 acre site adjacent to the new ikea store which is under construction the partnership between triple five and simon then known as melvin simon and associates to develop the mall of america began in 1987 after the mall opened in 1992 teachers insurance annuity association the financial services company converted its 650 million construction loan into an equity loan and was given a 55 percent stake in the property with simon and triple five each owning 225 percent in june 1999 however teachers now known as tiaa cref sold half its interest to simon for about 318 million in their lawsuit buttressed by dozens of e mail messages letters and secretly recorded telephone conversations the ghermezians argued that not only did simon not tell them about the negotiations but that simon executives tried to intimidate them once they heard about the transaction during the trial simon contended that teachers did not want to deal with the ghermezians and said that triple five did not have the money to buy the 275 percent interest rejecting these arguments the judge said triple five had enough cash in 1999 to buy all of the interest sold to simon as late as december 1998 the judge said teachers thought that the ghermezians might be involved in the transaction triple five bears some responsibility for its strained relationship with its partner judge magnuson wrote but he said evidence in the trial showed that simon executives engaged in behavior that can best be characterized as boorish behavior one might expect to see on a playground but not in dealings between sophisticated business partners he added business people can not and must not ignore ethics fairness and sound judgment when ordering their affairs this case presents an example of a situation in which business expediency overshadowed the very high duties the law imposes on partners correction september 15 2003 monday an article in business day on friday about a judge 's order to transfer control of the mall of america from the simon property group to a canadian company triple five referred incorrectly to parties that were found to have breached their fiduciary duty to triple five they were melvin and herbert simon and si minn lp not simon property si minn is a subsidiary of melvin simon associates that is controlled by melvin and herbert simon who are also co chairmen of simon property the article also misstated the location of another large mall west edmonton owned by triple five it is in edmonton alberta there is no municipality of west edmonton

a federal judge ruled wednesday that hasim rahman did not violate a long term contract with his former promoter when he signed a deal with don king in may to have king promote him but the judge miriam goldman cedarbaum said the former promoter cedric kushner had the legal right to act as rahman 's promoter in an expected rematch between rahman and lennox lewis the british heavyweight fighter who lost his international boxing federation and world boxing council titles to rahman in april after returning from that five round upset in south africa rahman dropped kushner and signed with king who tried to arrange a fight against david izon in beijing on aug 5 lewis and kushner each sued rahman and king saying they had breached contracts that rahman had signed cedarbaum ruled last week in federal district court in manhattan that rahman had to first fulfill a contractual obligation to give lewis a rematch before fighting anyone else for 18 months although kushner has the contractual right to sell rahman 's services in a rematch cedarbaum wrote in her decision the violation of that right is not so irreparable that it can not be compensated for by monetary damages what that means is that king can act as rahman 's promoter in the lewis rematch but he and rahman will have to pay kushner damages for a contractual breach a trial to determine the amount of damages is scheduled for october kushner 's lawyer rich edlin said that at a minimum king owed kushner all the money he would make off the rematch as far as we 're concerned king is working for us he said king said i do n't feed into that he declined yesterday to comment further but kushner 's side is not entirely pleased with the decision although edlin had argued that the rahman kushner promotion agreement should have lasted until mid june and that it had been extended beyond that with a 75000 check kushner had given one of rahman 's managers cedarbaum ruled that the original contract had expired in mid april at the latest king who agreed to give rahman a 5 million signing bonus in may is now legally rahman 's promoter before rahman left kushner hbo was offering 14 million to rahman to have a rematch with lewis while showtime was offering 20 million for a rahman mike tyson fight both of those deals were scrapped when king announced the rahman izon fight but now that rahman must fight lewis and there is no possibility of a bidding war it is almost certain that rahman will not get anything close to the original offer for the lewis bout the rahman izon fight had been scheduled on the undercard of a heavyweight title fight between evander holyfield and john ruiz the world boxing association champion the night the judge decided rahman must fight lewis a cable television company rainbow sports network backed out of a tentative agreement it had with king to distribute the beijing fight king said yesterday that his own television company kingvision will distribute the fight

three years after the city brought managed care to its jails and gave one hospital a set fee to care for the roughly 17000 inmates at the rikers island jail complex and the manhattan detention center the initiative has been quietly abandoned and the city appears set to return to the system it once derided as too costly and inefficient the city 's effort to contain costs and improve care at the jails which was built around a three year 342 million deal with st barnabas hospital in the bronx had been plagued by disputes over the city 's role in monitoring the care provided as well as a continuing criminal investigation into possible negligence by the hospital earlier this year st barnabas announced that it would not seek to renew its contract when it expires next february in april though the city began to solicit proposals for a new contract and the payment system it proposes is strikingly similar to the fee for service plan it had sought to overhaul under the old system the city reimbursed the medical provider for each inmate 's care and also paid for each inmate 's hospital visits without limit a system that it said led to excessive hospital visits related security risks and rising costs inmates made almost 10700 hospital visits a year when montefiore medical center held the contract often for minor ailments that could have been treated at the jails city officials said four medical providers including st vincent 's hospital in manhattan are presenting bids this week for a new contract which is likely to be the largest jail care contract in the country two other providers are bidding for a smaller part of the contract ernesto marrero the executive director of correctional health services the city unit that oversees jail care and developed the new contract said that the new contract would incorporate the best of both models st barnabas 's on site treatment centers and the designated triage doctors who send only the sickest inmates to the hospital will remain he said but because the city will reimburse its new provider only for care that it gives it will be better able to monitor how money is spent mr marrero added that a plan in which payments were capped or capitated served a purpose by giving st barnabas an incentive to improve care in the jails by expanding preventive care and creating specialty clinics on site with that goal met he said it was time to moderate the approach mr marrero acknowledged that since the current contract allowed st barnabas to submit projected and not actual spending and staffing levels it was hard for the city to know exactly how much profit the hospital was making or how much care it was providing i like as much control as possible he said and a capitated plan does n't give me as much control as i would like but conflicts over the contract with st barnabas continue on tuesday st barnabas filed a lawsuit against the health and hospitals corporation the parent of correctional health services asserting its right to remove key pieces of medical equipment from the rikers island jail complex along with intellectual property like software systems the managed care contract did not specifically compensate st barnabas for these items which it now owns as a result the lawsuit states mr marrero said that in any multimillion dollar contract litigation was always brewing inmate advocates are delighted with the new plan and say they hope it will restore the humanity in jail care and the ideal of rikers as a laboratory in which to treat medical and social ills that whole ethic has been ripped to shreds and stomped on the floor by st barnabas said john boston director of the prisoners rights project for the legal aid society the central concept of giving the provider a bag of money and saying 'you can keep what you do n't spend has certainly been abandoned when the managed care contract began in january 1998 with st barnabas as the provider city officials hailed the new venture as a remedy for the problem of open ended costs luis r marcos director of the health and hospitals corporation said it would provide an incentive not to send patients to the hospital unnecessarily but within six months two inmates had died after delayed hospitalization and the manhattan district attorney opened an investigation into criminal negligence in the deaths emergency room doctors said that many inmates sent to the city hospitals showed serious signs of neglect an internal report done by the city showed that in its first year st barnabas was on a path to make 14 million in profit in part by spending far less on each inmate than it proposed to the city it would as the city tried to defend st barnabas 's performance several officials at correctional health services quit their jobs saying that medical neglect was going unchecked however st barnabas which has formed a for profit entity that is seeking national jail care contracts and recently began a promotional web site has defended its performance saying that it reversed a jail care system in decline the critics notwithstanding st barnabas hospital has done an exceptional job at rikers island as evidenced by new services reduced inmate mortality and the fact that its employees and systems are being sought for the next vendor said gerald mckelvey a hospital spokesman he added that the city 's oversight was archaic and obsolete from its inception and called the quality of health care that st barnabas inherited deplorable with the contract in its final months the city and st barnabas agree on almost nothing for example correctional health services recently found that in the last quarter of 1999 st barnabas failed to meet 12 of 30 performance benchmarks outlined in the contract including providing required levels of asthma care and hiv testing the agency fined st barnabas 60000 but the hospital is refusing to pay asserting that the city has refused to divulge how it came up with those findings next month the city will select its new jail care provider and has emphasized in its request for proposals that complete cooperation with its monitoring efforts is essential
for this day at least there was no acrimony no angry fans no critical news media patrick ewing 's retirement after 17 mostly distinguished seasons as a pro basketball player turned into a lovefest there was ewing sitting at a table at a midtown hotel it 's a lot easier for me to sit because i do n't want to hurt my back announcing that he was retiring and disclosing that he would become an assistant coach for the washington wizards standing along the walls were former knicks teammates and rivals charles oakley allan houston mark jackson charlie ward herb williams alonzo mourning and kenny smith among those in the audience were mike jarvis who coached ewing at rindge and latin high school in cambridge mass and who now coaches at st john 's jeff van gundy the knicks coach during ewing 's final years in new york and don chaney the current knicks coach in his 15 seasons with the knicks followed by single seasons with the seattle supersonics and the orlando magic ewing a 7 foot center scored 24815 points the 13th highest nba total in 1996 he was voted one of the 50 greatest players in nba history he turned 40 last month and has been fighting injuries his retirement was no surprise i 've thought about it a lot ewing said basketball has been very good to me i 've made a lot of friends and some enemies i felt it was time for me to move on it was a great ride it was a hard decision to make because i think i could still play but it was time for me to go on to the next chapter of life critics in the news media often called ewing selfish more interested in personal than team accomplishments fans berated him mostly for never winning an nba championship but as oakley said of the sellout crowds at madison square garden they pay their money it 's not about being fair for one day love conquered all i love new york ewing said i would n't trade it for anything in the world the good the bad if i had to do it over again some things would change but i enjoyed every minute i enjoyed the fans they were great we had some good times i 'm sorry we could n't bring a championship here i hope that one day new york will have a champion i would n't be anywhere else than new york it will always be my home but not his next place of employment that will be in washington where he will assist doug collins and help coach the team president michael jordan if jordan plays another season not coincidentally ewing and jordan who were longtime rivals on the court have the same agent david falk when you 're a player people always ask you what you want to do when you finish ewing said i still do n't know the wizards offered me a job and i will take it it 's a learning experience i 'm going to work at it as hard as when i played i 'll still be involved i 'll be happy i 'm not going to consider myself just a big man 's coach i think i have got more to offer falk would not discuss specifics of ewing 's coaching contract it 's not signed yet falk said it 's short term he wants to see if he likes it it 's a two way audition ewing said he had coaching offers from a lot of other teams he said he talked with the knicks and was told they had nothing to offer this year but would have something next year his retirement ewing said is more or less final a few teams have called and said they needed a center he said but unless someone on the wizards goes down i do n't think it will happen in recent weeks ewing discussed the decision with williams his knicks understudy and now a knicks assistant john thompson his coach at georgetown and van gundy williams said he told ewing that coaching was far different from playing you 've got to get used to it williams said and doing it every day it 's not like coming in for two or three hours a day you 're there before the players come and you 're there after they go home it 's not like looking at one player on tape and figuring how to guard him you have to take a broader look van gundy said i think patrick will do well in learning to coach i do n't think you can determine until it 's done whether he will enjoy it coaching is a different life from playing it 's hard for any great player like himself when he 's coaching and has to deal with players less committed and less talented his knowledge of the game will help oakley a power forward who played with the chicago bulls last season was ewing 's teammate for 10 years on the knicks as a player patrick just came to work and put in a lot of effort oakley said as a coach he 'll do a good job jackson a former knicks point guard now with denver said what made patrick a great player was determination discipline and dedication i played against him when i was at st john 's and we were scared of him he was supposed to be a mean giant on and off the court
